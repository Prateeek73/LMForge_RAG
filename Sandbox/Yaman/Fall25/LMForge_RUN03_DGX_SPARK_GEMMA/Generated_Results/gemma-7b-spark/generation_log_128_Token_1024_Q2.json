It is a fundamental principle of common-law legal tradition because it provides consistency and predictability in the law. By following precedent, courts can ensure that similar cases are decided in the same way, which helps to promote fairness and justice. Additionally, stare decisis helps to avoid the need for courts to constantly re-litigate the same issues, which can be time-consuming and expensive.
