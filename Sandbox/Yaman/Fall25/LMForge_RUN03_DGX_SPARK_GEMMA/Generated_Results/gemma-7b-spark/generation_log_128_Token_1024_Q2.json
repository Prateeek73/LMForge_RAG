It is a fundamental principle of common-law legal tradition because it provides consistency and predictability in the law. By following precedent, courts can ensure that similar cases are decided in the same way, which helps to promote fairness and justice. Additionally, stare decisis helps to avoid the need for courts to constantly re-litigate the same issues, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

The housing bubble was caused by a combination of factors, including low interest rates, lax lending standards, and a lack of regulation. The subprime mortgage market was fueled by a desire to increase homeownership rates, but it led to a surge in risky loans that were ultimately unable to be repaid. The failure of major financial institutions was caused by a combination of factors, including poor risk management, excessive leverage, and a lack of transparency. These factors combined to create a perfect storm that led to the Great Recession."

Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole, including the behavior of aggregate variables such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are related in that the behavior of individual economic agents can have aggregate effects on the economy as a whole.

The business cycle is an important concept in economics, as it can help to explain why the economy grows and contracts over time. The business cycle is also important for policymakers, as it can help to inform decisions about fiscal and monetary policy. The business cycle is typically divided into four phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. During the expansion phase, the economy is growing and unemployment is low. During the peak phase, the economy is at its highest point and unemployment is at its lowest point. During the contraction phase, the economy is shrinking and unemployment is rising.

The double-entry accounting system is used to record all financial transactions, including purchases, sales, expenses, and revenues. It is used to track the company's assets, liabilities, and equity. It is also used to prepare financial statements, such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

Examples of assets include cash, inventory, property, and equipment. Liabilities are obligations that a company owes to others. Examples of liabilities include loans, accounts payable, and taxes. Assets and liabilities are important because they help to determine a company's financial health. Assets are used to generate income, while liabilities are used to pay for expenses. A company's assets and liabilities should be balanced in order to ensure that the company is financially stable. Assets and liabilities are also important for tax purposes. Assets are used to calculate a company's taxable income, while liabilities are used to calculate a company's tax liability. Assets and liabilities are also important for investors. Investors use assets and liabilities to determine a company's financial health and to decide whether or not to invest in the company. Assets and liabilities are also important for creditors. Creditors use assets and liabilities to determine a company's creditworthiness and to decide whether or not to lend money to the company. Assets and liabilities are important for many different reasons. They are used to determine a company's financial health, to calculate tax liability, and to decide whether or not to invest in a company.

It is called double-entry because each transaction affects at least two accounts. The system is based on the principle of double-entry bookkeeping, which states that for every debit there must be a corresponding credit. This principle ensures that the total of all debits equals the total of all credits, and that the accounting records are balanced. Double-entry accounting is used by businesses and organizations to track their financial transactions and to prepare financial statements. It is a fundamental part of the accounting process and is used by accountants and bookkeepers to ensure that financial records are accurate and complete."

It is one of the three main financial statements, along with the income statement and the balance sheet. The cash flow statement is used to analyze a company's liquidity, solvency, and ability to generate cash. It is also used to compare a company's performance to its competitors. The cash flow statement is divided into three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Operating activities include cash inflows and outflows related to the company's core operations, such as sales, purchases, and payroll. Investing activities include cash inflows and outflows related to the purchase and sale of assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. Financing activities include cash inflows and outflows related to the company's financing activities, such as debt and equity issuance.

The cash basis is a method of accounting that records transactions when cash is received or paid. This means that revenue is recorded when cash is received and expenses are recorded when cash is paid. The accrual basis is a method of accounting that records transactions when they occur, regardless of when cash is received or paid. This means that revenue is recorded when it is earned and expenses are recorded when they are incurred. The cash basis is simpler and easier to understand, but it does not provide as accurate a picture of a company's financial health as the accrual basis. The accrual basis is more complex, but it provides a more accurate picture of a company's financial health."
