Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between.

In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)?

Understand the differing roles of state law and federal law in the US legal system. \n4. Know the difference between criminal cases and civil cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n13 \n \nMost of what we discuss in this book is positive law—US positive law in particular. We will also \nconsider the laws and legal systems of other nations. But first, it will be useful to cover some basic \nconcepts and distinctions. \n \nLaw: The Moral Minimums in a Democratic Society \nThe law does not correct (or claim to correct) every wrong that occurs in society. At a minimum, it aims to \ncurb the worst kind of wrongs, the kinds of wrongs that violate what might be called the “moral \nminimums” that a community demands of its members. These include not only violations of criminal law \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\") but also torts (see Chapter 7 \"Introduction to Tort Law\") and broken \npromises (see Chapter 8 \"Contracts\"). Thus it may be wrong to refuse to return a phone call from a friend, \nbut that wrong will not result in a viable lawsuit against you. But if a phone (or the Internet) is used to \nlibel or slander someone, a tort has been committed, and the law may allow the defamed person to be \ncompensated. \nThere is a strong association between what we generally think of as ethical behavior and what the laws \nrequire and provide. For example, contract law upholds society’s sense that promises—in general—should \nbe kept. Promise-breaking is seen as unethical. The law provides remedies for broken promises (in breach \nof contract cases) but not for all broken promises; some excuses are accepted when it would be reasonable \nto do so. For tort law, harming others is considered unethical. If people are not restrained by law from \nharming one another, orderly society would be undone, leading to anarchy. Tort law provides for",

If people are not restrained by law from \nharming one another, orderly society would be undone, leading to anarchy. Tort law provides for \ncompensation when serious injuries or harms occur. As for property law issues, we generally believe that \nprivate ownership of property is socially useful and generally desirable, and it is generally protected (with \nsome exceptions) by laws. You can’t throw a party at my house without my permission, but my right to do \nwhatever I want on my own property may be limited by law; I can’t, without the public’s permission, \noperate an incinerator on my property and burn heavy metals, as toxic ash may be deposited throughout \nthe neighborhood. \n \nThe Common Law: Property, Torts, and Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n14 \nEven before legislatures met to make rules for society, disputes happened and judges decided them. In \nEngland, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision. They often \nresorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way. This is essentially reasoning by analogy. Thus the use of precedent in common-law cases \ncame into being, and a doctrine of stare decisis (pronounced STAR-ay-de-SIGH-sus) became accepted \nin English courts. Stare decisis means, in Latin, “let the decision stand.” \n \nMost judicial decisions that don’t apply legislative acts (known as statutes) will involve one of three areas \nof law—property, contract, or tort. Property law deals with the rights and duties of those who can legally \nown land (real property), how that ownership can be legally confirmed and protected, how property can \nbe bought and sold, what the rights of tenants (renters) are, and what the various kinds of “estates” in \nland are (e.g., fee simple, life estate, future interest, easements, or rights of way). Contract law deals with \nwhat kinds of promises courts should enforce. For example, should courts enforce a contract where one of \nthe parties was intoxicated, underage, or insane? Should courts enforce a contract where one of the \nparties seemed to have an unfair advantage? What kind of contracts would have to be in writing to be",

Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1]",

The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court.

When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury.

A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so.

Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you.

In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension.

If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life.

Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals.

Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice. \n \nFrom a modern perspective, some of these virtues seem old-fashioned or even odd.

Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear.

They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring.

You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs.

Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex.

Then, \nassuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: \n1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions \nthat might be made here? \n2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made. \n3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision. \n4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values. \n5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which \ndecision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders. \n \nIt is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why. In Milton \nFriedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders.

Shareholders \nelect directors, who then hire officers to manage the company. From this structure, some very basic \nrealities follow. Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers \nhired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are \nnot always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law \nrequire officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the \ncompany. This is the “agency problem” often discussed in corporate governance: how to get officers and \nother top management to align their own interests with those of the shareholders. For example, a CEO \nmight trade insider information to the detriment of the company’s shareholders. Even board members are \nsusceptible to misalignment of interets; for example, board members might resist hostile takeover bids \nbecause they would likely lose their perks (short for perquisites) as directors, even though the tender offer \nwould benefit stockholders. Among other attempted realignments, the use of stock options was an \nattempt to make managers more attentive to the value of company stock, but the law of unintended \nconsequences was in full force; managers tweaked and managed earnings in the bubble of the 1990s bull \nmarket, and “managing by numbers” became an epidemic in corporations organized under US corporate \nlaw.

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities?

Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist.

Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response.

If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay.

Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n•",

Understanding the long-standing \nperspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting \nout the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses. Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices. A firm that has purpose and passion \nbeyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself \nfor long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nConsider again Milton Friedman’s article. \na. What does Friedman mean by “ethical custom”? \nb. If the laws of the society are limiting the company’s profitability, would the company be within \nits rights to disobey the law? \nc. \nWhat if the law is “on the books,” but the company could count on a lack of enforcement from \nstate officials who were overworked and underpaid? Should the company limit its profits? \nSuppose that it could save money by discharging a pollutant into a nearby river, adversely \naffecting fish and, potentially, drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities. In \npolluting against laws that aren’t enforced, is it still acting “within the rules of the game”? What \nif almost all other companies in the industry were saving money by doing similar acts? \n2 \nConsider again the Harris v. Forklift case at the end of Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Law and Legal \nSystems\". The Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Harris was entitled to be heard again by the federal \ndistrict court, which means that there would be a trial on her claim that Mr. Hardy, owner of Forklift \nSystems, had created a “hostile working environment” for Ms. Harris. Apart from the legal aspects, \ndid he really do anything unethical? How can you tell? \na. Which of his actions, if any, were contrary to utilitarian thinking?",

Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts. The Constitution \nestablished diversity jurisdiction because it was feared that local courts would be hostile toward \npeople from other states and that they would need separate courts. In 2009, nearly a third of all \nlawsuits filed in federal court were based on diversity of citizenship. In these cases, the federal courts \nwere applying state law, rather than taking federal question jurisdiction, where federal law \nprovided the basis for the lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or defendant). \n \nWhy are there so many diversity cases in federal courts?

This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals.

A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states).

The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract.

Within both state and federal court \nsystems, it is useful to know the different kinds of courts and what cases they can decide. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why all of this complexity? Why don’t state courts hear only claims based on state law, and federal courts \nonly federal-law-based claims? \n2. Why would a plaintiff in Iowa with a case against a New Jersey defendant prefer to have the case heard in \nIowa? \n3. James, a New Jersey resident, is sued by Jonah, an Iowa resident. After a trial in which James appears and \nvigorously defends himself, the Iowa state court awards Jonah $136,750 dollars in damages for his tort \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n89 \nclaim. In trying to collect from James in New Jersey, Jonah must have the New Jersey court certify the Iowa \njudgment. Why, ordinarily, must the New Jersey court do so? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.2 The Problem of Jurisdiction \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

For example, federal courts have jurisdiction when a federal law is being used by the \nplaintiff or prosecutor (a “federal question” case) or the case arises “in admiralty” (meaning that the \nproblem arose not on land but on sea, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any state, or in navigable \nwaters within the United States). Implied in this list is the clear notion that states would continue to have \ntheir own laws, interpreted by their own courts, and that federal courts were needed only where the issues \nraised by the parties had a clear federal connection. The exception to this is diversity jurisdiction, \ndiscussed later. \n \nThe Constitution was constructed with the idea that state courts would continue to deal with basic kinds \nof claims such as tort, contract, or property claims. Since states sanction marriages and divorce, state \ncourts would deal with “domestic” (family) issues. Since states deal with birth and death records, it stands \nto reason that paternity suits, probate disputes, and the like usually wind up in state courts. You wouldn’t \ngo to the federal building or courthouse to get a marriage license, ask for a divorce, or probate a will: these \nmatters have traditionally been dealt with by the states (and the thirteen original colonies before them). \nMatters that historically get raised and settled in state court under state law include not only domestic and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n91 \nprobate matters but also law relating to corporations, partnerships, agency, contracts, property, torts, and \ncommercial dealings generally.

People have had a need to resolve this kind of dispute long before our federal courts were created, \nand you can tell from Article III that the founders did not specify that tort or negligence claims should be \nhandled by the federal courts.

But no state can reach out beyond the limits of what is constitutionally permissible under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, which binds the states with its proviso to guarantee the due process rights of \nthe citizens of every state in the union. The “minimum contacts” test in Burger King v. \nRudzewicz (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") tries to make the fairness mandate of the due process clause more \nspecific. So do other tests articulated in the case (such as “does not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice”). These tests are posed by the Supreme Court and heeded by all lower courts in \norder to honor the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process guarantees. These tests are in \naddition to any state long-arm statute’s instructions to courts regarding the assertion of personal \njurisdiction over nonresidents. \n \nChoice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses \nIn a series of cases, the Supreme Court has made clear that it will honor contractual choices of parties in a \nlawsuit. Suppose the parties to a contract wind up in court arguing over the application of the contract’s \nterms. If the parties are from two different states, the judge may have difficulty determining which law to \napply (see Table 3.1 \"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). But if the contract says that a particular state’s \nlaw will be applied if there is a dispute, then ordinarily the judge will apply that state’s law as a rule of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n105 \ndecision in the case.

A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests.

The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER).

A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides.

Explain how a court’s judgment is translated into relief for the winning party. \n \n \nJudgment or Order \nAt the end of a trial, the judge will enter an order that makes findings of fact (often with the help of a jury) \nand conclusions of law. The judge will also make a judgment as to what relief or remedy should be given. \nOften it is an award of money damages to one of the parties. The losing party may ask for a new trial at \nthis point or within a short period of time following. Once the trial judge denies any such request, the \njudgment—in the form of the court’s order—is final. \n \nAppeal \nIf the loser’s motion for a new trial or a judgment n.o.v. is denied, the losing party may appeal but must \nordinarily post a bond sufficient to ensure that there are funds to pay the amount awarded to the winning \nparty. In an appeal, the appellant aims to show that there was some prejudicial error committed by the \ntrial judge. There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic \nidea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides.

As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the \nparty defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent). \n \nDuring the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge. In \ncompiling a record on appeal, the appellant needs to show the appellate court some examples of mistakes \nmade by the judge—for example, having erroneously admitted evidence, having failed to admit proper \nevidence that should have been admitted, or having wrongly instructed the jury. The appellate court must \ndetermine if those mistakes were serious enough to amount to prejudicial error. \n \nAppellate and trial procedures are different. The appellate court does not hear witnesses or accept \nevidence. It reviews the record of the case—the transcript of the witnesses’ testimony and the documents",

Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts. \n2. Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n121 \n \n \nAlmost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney. But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue?

But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave.

Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n \nLegal Fees \nLawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. \nA flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance \napproximately how long it will take her to do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are \nexamples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the \nworth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price. \n \nLawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial \nmatters. Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range \nfrom $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time. \n \nA contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the \nsuccess of the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., \nautomobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite often, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n125 \ncontingent fee is controversial. Trial lawyers justify it by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such \nlawsuits.

Few people have that kind of \nmoney or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit.

That is not the general rule in this country. Here, each party must pay \nmost of its own costs, including (and especially) the fees of lawyers. (Certain relatively minor costs, such \nas filing fees for various documents required in court, are chargeable to the losing side, if the judge \ndecides it.) This type of fee structure is known as the American rule (in contrast to the British rule). \n \nThere are two types of exceptions to the American rule. By statute, Congress and the state legislatures \nhave provided that the winning party in particular classes of cases may recover its full legal costs from the \nloser—for example, the federal antitrust laws so provide and so does the federal Equal Access to Justice \nAct. The other exception applies to litigants who either initiate lawsuits in bad faith, with no expectation \nof winning, or who defend them in bad faith, in order to cause the plaintiff great expense. Under these \ncircumstances, a court has the discretion to award attorneys’ fees to the winner.

The parties use a private decision maker, the arbitrator, and the \nrules of procedure are considerably more relaxed than those that apply in the courtroom. Arbitrators \nmight be retired judges, lawyers, or anyone with the kind of specialized knowledge and training that \nwould be useful in making a final, binding decision on the dispute. In a contractual relationship, the \nparties can decide even before a dispute arises to use arbitration when the time comes. Or parties can \ndecide after a dispute arises to use arbitration instead of litigation. In a predispute arbitration agreement \n(often part of a larger contract), the parties can spell out the rules of procedure to be used and the method \nfor choosing the arbitrator. For example, they may name the specific person or delegate the responsibility \nof choosing to some neutral person, or they may each designate a person and the two designees may \njointly pick a third arbitrator. \n \nMany arbitrations take place under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, a private \norganization headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many other cities.

First, it is usually much quicker, because the arbitrator \ndoes not have a backlog of cases and because the procedures are simpler. Second, in complex cases, the \nquality of the decision may be higher, because the parties can select an arbitrator with specialized \nknowledge. \n \nUnder both federal and state law, arbitration is favored, and a decision rendered by an arbitrator is \nbinding by law and may be enforced by the courts.

Under the Federal Arbitration Act, the other party can go to court and \nget a stay against your litigation and also get an order compelling you to go to arbitration. \n \nMediation \nUnlike adjudication, mediation gives the neutral party no power to impose a decision. The mediator is a \ngo-between who attempts to help the parties negotiate a solution. The mediator will communicate the \nparties’ positions to each other, will facilitate the finding of common ground, and will suggest outcomes. \nBut the parties have complete control: they may ignore the recommendations of the mediator entirely, \nsettle in their own way, find another mediator, agree to binding arbitration, go to court, or forget the \nwhole thing! \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n129 \nLitigation is not the only way to resolve disputes.

The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware).

Moreover, \nGriswold illustrates another important and much-debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive \ndue process (see Section 4.5.3 \"Fifth Amendment\"). The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is \nbrought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business \nafter Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited \nrather than overruled Roe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, \nand efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In \ndeciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the \nSupreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the \nConstitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its \ninterpretation.

The court found that \nCongress did not. The court cited several cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be \nconstitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden.

The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v.

For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed!

It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 \nwhen the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that \nprohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The law was part of a twenty-year trend \n(roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime. Lopez’s \nlawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged \nthe law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this \nlegislation. The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the \nSupreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because \neducation of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near \nschool yards detracted from students’ education. The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the \ngovernment’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything. \nLopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court. \n \nCongress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided. But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair \ninterstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy \nBrzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players \nat Virginia Tech, had raped her.

Justice John Paul \nStevens argued that the court’s precedents established Congress’s commerce clause power to regulate \npurely local activities that are part of a “class of activities” with a substantial effect on interstate \ncommerce. The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a \nclass of activities: the national marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in the national \nmarijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use “essential” to regulating the drug’s national \nmarket. \nNotice how similar this reasoning is to the court’s earlier reasoning in Wickard v. Filburn (Section 4.6.2). \nIn contrast, the court’s conservative wing was adamant that federal power had been exceeded. Justice \nClarence Thomas’s dissent in Gonzalez v. Raich stated that Raich’s local cultivation and consumption of \nmarijuana was not “Commerce…among the several States.” Representing the “originalist” view that the",

Understand that when Congress does not exercise its powers under the commerce clause, the Supreme \nCourt may still limit state legislation that discriminates against interstate commerce or places an undue \nburden on interstate commerce. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n154 \n2. Distinguish between “discrimination” dormant-commerce-clause cases and “undue burden” dormant-\ncommerce-clause cases. \n \n \nCongress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause and often does legislate. For example, \nCongress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in \nlength. But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and \nlength of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules. States may do so under the so-\ncalled historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government. \nThese police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, \nmorals, and the environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when \nstate action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate. This power is \nclaimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause. \n \nThere are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an \n“undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be \nstruck down. Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 \"Summary and Exercises\", is an example \nof a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on \nits highways.

The Commerce Clause is an explicit grant of power to Congress to regulate commerce, while the Dormant Commerce Clause is a judicial doctrine that limits the power of states to regulate commerce. The Dormant Commerce Clause is based on the principle that states cannot discriminate against interstate commerce or place an undue burden on interstate commerce. The Dormant Commerce Clause is a judicially created doctrine that is not explicitly stated in the Constitution, but is based on the principle of federalism and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution."

For \nexample, in Oregon Waste Systems v. Department of Environmental Quality, the state wanted to place a \nslightly higher charge on waste coming from out of state. [2] The state’s reasoning was that in-state \nresidents had already contributed to roads and other infrastructure and that tipping fees at waste facilities \nshould reflect the prior contributions of in-state companies and residents. Out-of-state waste handlers \nwho wanted to use Oregon landfills objected and won their dormant commerce clause claim that Oregon’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n155 \nlaw discriminated “on its face” against interstate commerce. Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything \nthat moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of \nsomething instead of buying something. \n \nThus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing \nthat differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that \noriginate elsewhere. If Michigan were to let counties decide for themselves whether to take garbage from \noutside of the county or not, this could also be a discrimination based on a place of origin outside the \nstate. (Suppose, for instance, each county were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then \nall Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste from outside of Michigan, which is \ndiscriminatory.) [3] \n \nThe Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste requirements that did not differentiate on the \nbasis of origin. If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific hazards, then the law would apply \nequally to in-state and out-of-state garbage. Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could \nstill act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state \nwaste from coming into their own borders.

By early this year, barring unforeseen \ndevelopments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal. \nWhy can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada? They say that after 20 years of searching they \nhave not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage. Ontario has about \n345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles.

The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant.

In this regard, as the Supreme Court has observed, the due process \nclause protects abstract liberty interests, including the right to personal autonomy, bodily integrity, self-\ndignity, and self-determination. \n \nThese liberty interests often are grouped to form a general right to privacy, which was first recognized \nin Griswold v.

Unfair classifications among people or corporations will not be \npermitted. A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white \nchildren and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public \nservices, such as water fountains or restrooms. Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954). [6] \n \nGovernments make classifications every day, so not all classifications can be illegal under the equal \nprotection clause. People with more income generally pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n171 \nPeople with proper medical training are licensed to become doctors; people without that training cannot \nbe licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do practice medicine. To know what classifications are \npermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified. The court has \ncreated three classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by \nknowing how the court is likely to classify the case: \n \n• \nMinimal scrutiny: economic and social relations. Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights.

So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen.

It has been \nhis practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; \nto sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use \nsome in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. \n \nHis 1941 wheat acreage allotment was 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He \nsowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under \nthe terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty \nof 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. \n \nThe general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the \nvolume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the \nconsequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce.

Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities \nthrough Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west \ncoast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route. \n \nConsolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks. One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40-foot two-\naxle trailer. This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall. Such trucks have \nlong been used on the Nation’s highways. Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle \ntrailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single-axle trailer. This combination, known \nas a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall. Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, \nincreasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities. Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways. Unlike all \nother States in the West and Midwest, Iowa generally prohibits the use of 65-foot doubles within its \nborders. \n \n… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n180",

Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce \nimposed by Iowa’s law. On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests.",

It accepted the District Court’s \nfinding that 65-foot doubles were as safe as 55-foot singles. Id. at 1069. Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. Id. at 1070-1071. The combination of these exemptions \nweakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation.

Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce. It has long been \nrecognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n182 \nstate to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect \ninterstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v.

It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local \nconcern. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350. For example, regulations that \ntouch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to \ninvalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited). Indeed, “if safety justifications are \nnot illusory, the Court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison \nwith related burdens on interstate commerce.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 449. Those who would \nchallenge such bona fide safety regulations must overcome a “strong presumption of validity.” Bibb v. \nNavajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 at (1959). \nBut the incantation of a purpose to promote the public health or safety does not insulate a state law from \nCommerce Clause attack.

Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded \nthe use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as \nin Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-\nfoot singles. Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western \nStates. Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck. In the absence of \ncongressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must \nbe tolerated. But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its \nregulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state \nlaw cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause. \n \n \n \nA \nIowa made a more serious effort to support the safety rationale of its law than did Wisconsin in Raymond, \nbut its effort was no more persuasive. As noted above, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” The record supports this finding. The trial focused on a \ncomparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories. The evidence \nshowed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in \nthe ability to brake, turn, and maneuver. The double, because of its axle placement, produces less splash \nand spray in wet weather. And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to",

And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to \ndangerous “off-tracking,” and to wind. \n \nNone of these findings is seriously disputed by Iowa. Indeed, the State points to only three ways in which \nthe 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; \nthey may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife. \n \nThe first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways. As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections. The concern over backing \ncapability also is insignificant, because it seldom is necessary to back up on an interstate. In any event, no \nevidence suggested any difference in backing capability between the 60-foot doubles that Iowa permits \nand the 65-foot doubles that it bans. Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than \nsingles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles. \n \nStatistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and \n60-foot doubles. One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative \naccident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles. Each kind of truck was driven 56 million \nmiles on identical routes. The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one \nfatality. The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Iowa’s \nexpert statistician admitted that this study provided “moderately strong evidence” that singles have a \nhigher injury rate than doubles. Another study, prepared by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the \nrequest of the state legislature, concluded that “[s]ixty-five foot twin trailer combinations have not been \nshown by experiences in other states to be less safe than 60-foot twin trailer",

We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system.

Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and \ninformative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment \nrights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted \nmessages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic \nviews. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to \npoint out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials. \n \nRapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression—\ncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. \nToday, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. Soon, \nhowever, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide \ncitizens with significant information about political candidates and issues. Yet, §441b would seem to ban a \nblog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with \ncorporate funds. The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions \nbased on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech. \n \nDue consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is overruled.

To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1.

The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency.

One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that \nindependent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may \ndirectly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may \noversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by \nCongress). \n \nPowers of Agencies \nAgencies have a variety of powers.

Many agencies also have the \nauthority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies \ncan regulate business practices.

Understand how Congress controls administrative agencies. \n3. Understand how the courts can control administrative agencies. \n \n \nDuring the course of the past seventy years, a substantial debate has been conducted, often in shrill \nterms, about the legitimacy of administrative lawmaking. One criticism is that agencies are \n“captured” by the industry they are directed to regulate. Another is that they overregulate, stifling \nindividual initiative and the ability to compete. During the 1960s and 1970s, a massive outpouring of \nfederal law created many new agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones. In the \nlate 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress began to deregulate American society, and \nderegulation increased under the Reagan administration. But the accounting frauds of WorldCom, \nEnron, and others led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown of 2008 has \nled to reregulation of the financial sector. It remains to be seen whether the Deepwater Horizon oil \nblowout of 2010 will lead to more environmental regulations or a rethinking on how to make \nagencies more effective regulators. \n \nAdministrative agencies are the focal point of controversy because they are policy-making bodies, \nincorporating facets of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form that fits uneasily at \nbest in the framework of American government (see Figure 5.1 \"Major Administrative Agencies of the \nUnited States\"). They are necessarily at the center of tugging and hauling by the legislature, the \nexecutive branch, and the judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising political control \nover them. In early 1990, for example, the Bush administration approved a Food and Drug \nAdministration regulation that limited disease-prevention claims by food packagers, reversing a \nposition by the Reagan administration in 1987 permitting such claims. \n \nFigure 5.1 Major Administrative Agencies of the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n214",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision.

This means, in essence, authority to legislate. The outpouring of federal regulations has been \nimmense. The APA directs agencies about to engage in rulemaking to give notice in the \nFederal Register of their intent to do so. The Federal Register is published daily, Monday through \nFriday, in Washington, DC, and contains notice of various actions, including announcements of proposed \nrulemaking and regulations as adopted. The notice must specify the time, place, and nature of the \nrulemaking and offer a description of the proposed rule or the issues involved.

Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an \nunderage patron to the store). Or a junkyard that specializes in automobiles and automobile parts may \nalso be subject to surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly likely to be active in the \nresale of stolen autos or stolen auto parts.

The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose.

Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route.

Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v.

Thus, § 6(b)(5) directs the \nSecretary to issue the standard that “most adequately assures…that no employee will suffer material \nimpairment of health,” limited only by the extent to which this is “capable of being done.” In effect then, \nas the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits, by \nplacing the “benefit” of worker health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this \n“benefit” unachievable. Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that \nstrikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth \nin § 6(b)(5).

This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize.

Medical marijuana was not legal fifty years ago when its use began \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n242 \nto become widespread, and in some states its use or possession was a felony. Now, some states make \nit legal to use or possess it under some circumstances. In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set \nin the United States through the Constitution’s prohibition on “cruel or unusual punishments.” \n \nIt is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. But there are far too many criminal laws for \nanyone to know them all. Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of \n“criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving \nwithout a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society. You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws. Teenagers hanging around \nthe sidewalks on Main Street were sometimes arrested for “loitering.” The constitutional void-for-\nvagueness doctrine has led the courts to overturn statutes that are not clear. For example, “vagrancy”",

An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing.

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law.

In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car. If the finance company repossesses the car, the \ncustomer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have \ntaken the new car by larceny or embezzlement. Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the \ndealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying.

The forged instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood. If \nyou fake your neighbor’s signature on one of his checks made out to cash, you have committed forgery. \nBut if you sign a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that there is no money in your \nchecking account, the instrument is not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the intent to \ndefraud. \n \nThe mere making of a forged instrument is unlawful. So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an \ninstrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false signature is \nby no means the only way to commit forgery.
