This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve. \n3. Explain how politics and law are related. \n4. Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws. \n5. Understand some basic differences between the US legal system and other legal systems. \n \n \nLaw has different meanings as well as different functions. Philosophers have considered issues of \njustice and law for centuries, and several different approaches, or schools of legal thought, have \nemerged. In this chapter, we will look at those different meanings and approaches and will consider \nhow social and political dynamics interact with the ideas that animate the various schools of legal \nthought. We will also look at typical sources of “positive law” in the United States and how some of \nthose sources have priority over others, and we will set out some basic differences between the US \nlegal system and other legal systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.1 What Is Law? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n4 \n \nLaw is a word that means different things at different times. Black’s Law Dictionary says that law is “a \nbody of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force. That \nwhich must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1] \n \nFunctions of the Law \nIn a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual \nrights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly \nsocial change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \nauthoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \nor political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism, \nEuropean nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \nthose same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by \nSpain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the",

            "chunk": "to be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence. \nSome Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to \noverturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n11 \nRelated to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought. This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nEach of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource. Which school of legal thought does \nher criticism reflect? \n2. Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” \nWhich school of legal thought is represented by this quote? \n3. Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard \nunder Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual \nextermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald. After an Israeli “extraction team” took him \nfrom Argentina to Israel, he was put on trial for “crimes against humanity.” His defense was that he was \n“just following orders.” Explain why Eichmann was not an adherent of the natural-law school of legal \nthought. \n \n  \n \n[1] Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, s.v. “natural law.” \n[2] Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” \n \n \n \n1.3 Basic Concepts and Categories of US Positive Law \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations).

Describe the different sources of law in the US legal system and the principal institutions that create those \nlaws. \n2. Explain in what way a statute is like a treaty, and vice versa. \n3. Explain why the Constitution is “prior” and has priority over the legislative acts of a majority, whether in the \nUS Congress or in a state legislature. \n4. Describe the origins of the common-law system and what common law means. \n \n \nSources of Law \nIn the United States today, there are numerous sources of law. The main ones are (1) constitutions—both \nstate and federal, (2) statutes and agency regulations, and (3) judicial decisions. In addition, chief \nexecutives (the president and the various governors) can issue executive orders that have the effect of law. \n \nIn international legal systems, sources of law include treaties (agreements between states or countries) \nand what is known as customary international law (usually consisting of judicial decisions from national \ncourt systems where parties from two or more nations are in a dispute). \n \nAs you might expect, these laws sometimes conflict: a state law may conflict with a federal law, or a \nfederal law might be contrary to an international obligation. One nation’s law may provide one \nsubstantive rule, while another nation’s law may provide a different, somewhat contrary rule to apply. Not \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n20 \nall laws, in other words, are created equal. To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to \nunderstand the relationships between the various kinds of law. \n \n \nConstitutions \nConstitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives",

The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes,",

States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes, \nzoning laws, and misdemeanors or infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking. Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

Describe how the common-law system differs from the civil-law system. \n \n \nOther legal and political systems are very different from the US system, which came from English \ncommon-law traditions and the framers of the US Constitution. Our legal and political traditions are \ndifferent both in what kinds of laws we make and honor and in how disputes are resolved in court. \n \nComparing Common-Law Systems with Other Legal Systems \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n30 \nThe common-law tradition is unique to England, the United States, and former colonies of the British \nEmpire. Although there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most nations do not permit \ntheir judiciaries to declare legislative acts unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently), all \nof them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases, and none of them relies on the comprehensive, \nlegislative codes that are prevalent in civil-law systems. \n \nCivil-Law Systems \nThe main alternative to the common-law legal system was developed in Europe and is based in Roman \nand Napoleonic law. A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal rules are in one or more \ncomprehensive legislative enactments. During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws—a code—\nwas developed for all of France. The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French",

Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

            "chunk": "plaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission’s new regulations on this subject, see 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29 CFR §§ \n1609.1, 1609.2); see also 29 CFR § 1604.11 (1993). But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while \npsychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is \nrequired. \n \nIII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n37 \nForklift, while conceding that a requirement that the conduct seriously affect psychological well-\nbeing is unfounded, argues that the District Court nonetheless correctly applied the Meritor \nstandard. We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.” \n \nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nSo ordered. \n \nNote to Students \n \nThis was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case. Many \nfeminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile-working-\nenvironment claims under Title VII more difficult to win. That did not happen. When the question to be \ndecided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case. Here, the question that the \ncourt poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological \ninjury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the \ncourt revisits a similar question and answers it differently. This does happen, but happens rarely. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Is this a criminal case or a civil-law case? How can you tell? \n2. Is the court concerned with making a procedural rule here, or is the court making a statement about the \nsubstantive law? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n38 \n3. Is this a case where the court is interpreting the Constitution, a federal statute, a state statute, or the \ncommon law? \n4. In Harris v. Forklift, what if the trial judge does not personally agree that women should have any rights to \nequal treatment in the workplace? Why shouldn’t that judge dismiss the case even before trial? Or should \nthe judge dismiss the case after giving the female plaintiff her day in court? \n5. What was the employer’s argument in this case? Do you agree or disagree with it? What if those who \nlegislated Title VII gave no thought to the question of seriousness of injury at all? \n \n \n \n \n1.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThere are differing conceptions of what law is and of what law should be. Laws and legal systems differ \nworldwide. The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government. The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, \npositive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies.

Define ethics and explain the importance of good ethics for business people and business \norganizations. \n2. Understand the principal philosophies of ethics, including utilitarianism, duty-based ethics, and virtue \nethics. \n3. Distinguish between the ethical merits of various choices by using an ethical decision model. \n4. Explain the difference between shareholder and stakeholder models of ethical corporate governance. \n5. Explain why it is difficult to establish and maintain an ethical corporate culture in a business \norganization. \n \n \nFew subjects are more contentious or important as the role of business in society, particularly, \nwhether corporations have social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing shareholder \nvalue. While the phrase “business ethics” is not oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is \nplenty of evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out primarily for themselves. However, \nbusiness organizations ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers, employees, the \nmedia, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government officials, and socially responsible \ninvestors at their peril. Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term interests of many \ncompanies, who find that sustainable profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as \nwell as profits. \n \nThis chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential businesspeople to the differences \nbetween legal compliance and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical perspectives \nthat apply to business, businesspeople, and the role of business organizations in society. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n43 \n \n \n \n2.1 What Is Ethics? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain how both individuals and institutions can be viewed as ethical or unethical. \n2. Explain how law and ethics are different, and why a good reputation can be more important than legal \ncompliance. \n \n \nMost of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality. \nThe question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in \nany situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act \nis “better” in a moral or ethical sense than some other act?  \nPeople sometimes speak of morality as something personal but view ethics as having wider social \nimplications. Others see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being ethics. Ethics \nwould be morality as applied to any number of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, \nor the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants. We will venture a \ndefinition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms. \nPeople often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of \ncorporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation. For example, if North Korea is characterized by the US \npresident as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in \ncertain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n44 \n \nIn talking about morality, we often use the word good; but that word can be confusing. If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values.

Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who \nfounded the firm built it on integrity and straightforward practices. “Think straight, talk straight” was the \ncompany’s motto. Andersen established the company’s reputation for integrity over a hundred years ago \nby refusing to play numbers games for a potentially lucrative client. \nMaximizing profits while being legally compliant is not a very inspiring goal for a business. People in an \norganization need some quality or excellence to strive for. By focusing on pushing the edge of what is \nlegal, by looking for loopholes in the law that would help create short-term financial gain, companies have \noften learned that in the long term they are not actually satisfying the market, the shareholders, the \nsuppliers, or the community generally. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLegal compliance is not the same as acting ethically. Your reputation, individually or corporately, depends on \nhow others regard your actions. Goodwill is hard to measure or quantify, but it is real nonetheless and can \nbest be protected by acting ethically. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Describe the various major theories about ethics in human decision making. \n2. Begin considering how the major theories about ethics apply to difficult choices in life and business. \n \n \nThere are several well-respected ways of looking at ethical issues. Some of them have been around for \ncenturies. It is important to know that many who think a lot about business and ethics have deeply held \nbeliefs about which perspective is best. Others would recommend considering ethical problems from a \nvariety of different perspectives. Here, we take a brief look at (1) utilitarianism, (2) deontology, (3) social \njustice and social contract theory, and (4) virtue theory. We are leaving out some important perspectives, \nsuch as general theories of justice and “rights” and feminist thought about ethics and patriarchy. \n \nUtilitarianism \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n50 \nUtilitarianism is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is well aligned with economics and the \nfree-market outlook that has come to dominate much current thinking about business, management, and \neconomics. Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill \n(who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. \nUtilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each.

The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct",

Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society, \nbelieving that the government should play that role. Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n54 \noften admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, \nassistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, \neducation, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security). \n \nPeople who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government \ngoods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all. One response \nmight be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in \na “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government. He called this \nthe social contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and \ncommon benefits. In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good. Your college or \nschool is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks \nbehind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, \nthe sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, \nor standards that people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free \n(though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country. \n \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules \nof smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or \nCalifornia) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be seen as a \nfundamental social contract. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n55 \nIt is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as \nthe US Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and \norganic changes. Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain \nfundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not. People can give up \nfreedom-oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches \nand seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example, many citizens in \nRussia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and \npredictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom. \n \nThus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the \nsociety. This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni.

It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope. \n \nThe relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: \n \n1. If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy. [2] \n \nAs to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove \nhelpful. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n58 \nMichael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core values has been \nidentified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate \ndecisions. \n \nTo simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States. \nWhen you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, \npower, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality. They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But",

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities? Only people can have \nresponsibilities. A corporation is an artificial person and in this sense may have artificial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n67 \nresponsibilities, but “business” as a whole cannot be said to have responsibilities, even in this \nvague sense.… \n \nPresumably, the individuals who are to be responsible are businessmen, which means individual \nproprietors or corporate executives.…In a free enterprise, private-property system, a corporate \nexecutive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his \nemployers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which \ngenerally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the \nsociety, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.… \n \n…[T]he manager is that agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the \neleemosynary institution, and his primary responsibility is to them… \nOf course, the corporate executive is also a person in his own right. As a person, he may have \nother responsibilities that he recognizes or assumes voluntarily—to his family, his conscience, his \nfeeling of charity, his church, his clubs, his city, his country. He may feel impelled by these \nresponsibilities to devote part of his income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse to work for \nparticular corporations, even to leave his job…But in these respects he is acting as a principal, not \nan agent; he is spending his own money or time or energy, not the money of his employers or the \ntime or energy he has contracted to devote to their purposes. If these are “social responsibilities,” \nthey are the social responsibilities of individuals, not of business. \n \nWhat does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a “social responsibility” in his capacity \nas businessman? If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation. Or that he is to make \nexpenditures on reducing pollution beyond the amount that is in the best interests of the",

But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be \naffected by corporate decisions. \n \nAccording to stakeholder theorists, corporations (and other business organizations) must pay attention \nnot only to the bottom line but also to their overall effect on the community. Public perception of a \ncompany’s unfairness, uncaring, disrespect, or lack of trustworthiness often leads to long-term failure, \nwhatever the short-term successes or profits may be. A socially responsible corporation is likely to \nconsider the impact of its decisions on a wide range of stakeholders, not just shareholders. As Table 2.1 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n70 \n\"The Stakes of Various Stakeholders\" indicates, stakeholders have very different kinds of interests \n(“stakes”) in the actions of a corporation. \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.1 The Stakes of Various Stakeholders \nOwnership \nThe value of the organization has a direct impact on the wealth of these \nstakeholders. \nManagers \nDirectors who \nown stock \nShareholders \nEconomic \nDependence \nStakeholders can be economically dependent without having ownership. \nEach of these stakeholders relies on the corporation in some way for \nfinancial well-being. \nSalaried \nmanagers \nCreditors \nSuppliers \nEmployees \nLocal \ncommunities \nSocial Interests \nThese stakeholders are not directly linked to the organization but have \nan interest in making sure the organization acts in a socially responsible \nmanner. \nCommunities \nGovernment \nMedia \n \nCorporate Culture and Codes of Ethics \nA corporation is a “person” capable of suing, being sued, and having rights and duties in our legal system. \n(It is a legal or juridical person, not a natural person, according to our Supreme Court.) Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and",

In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels. At the \nfirst level are the federal district courts, which are the trial courts in the federal system. Every state has \none or more federal districts; the less populous states have one, and the more populous states (California, \nTexas, and New York) have four. The federal court with the heaviest commercial docket is the US District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). There are forty-four district judges and fifteen \nmagistrates in this district.

Each circuit oversees the work of the district courts in \nseveral states. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district \ncourts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears \nappeals from district courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, \nHawaii, and Guam. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals from the \ndistrict court in Washington, DC, as well as from numerous federal administrative agencies (see Chapter 5 \n\"Administrative Law\"). The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington, hears \nappeals in patent and customs cases. Appeals are usually heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes \nthere will be a rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges sit to hear the case “en \nbanc.” \n \nThere are also several specialized courts in the federal judicial system. These include the US Tax Court, \nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims. \n \nUnited States Supreme Court \nOverseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC. It consists of nine justices—the \nchief justice and eight associate justices. (This number is not constitutionally required; Congress can \nestablish any number. It has been set at nine since after the Civil War.) The Supreme Court has selective \ncontrol over most of its docket. By law, the cases it hears represent only a tiny fraction of the cases that are \nsubmitted. In 2008, the Supreme Court had numerous petitions (over 7,000, not including thousands of \npetitions from prisoners) but heard arguments in only 87 cases. The Supreme Court does not sit in panels. \nAll the justices hear and consider each case together, unless a justice has a conflict of interest and must \nwithdraw from hearing the case. \n \nFigure 3.1 The Federal Judicial Circuits \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n88 \n \nFederal judges—including Supreme Court justices—are nominated by the president and must be \nconfirmed by the Senate.

After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge.

If the plaintiff successfully \nappeals a summary judgment motion, the case will come back to the trial court. \n \nPrior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in an effort to investigate the possibilities of \nsettlement. Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the \nattorneys. The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

If not voluntarily, then the \nlosing party’s assets can be seized or its wages or other income garnished to satisfy the judgment. If the \nfinal judgment is an injunction, failure to follow its dictates can lead to a contempt citation, with a fine or \njail time imposed. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe process of conducting a civil trial has many aspects, starting with pleadings and continuing with motions, \ndiscovery, more motions, pretrial conferences, and finally the trial itself. At all stages, the rules of civil \nprocedure attempt to give both sides plenty of notice, opportunity to be heard, discovery of relevant \ninformation, cross-examination, and the preservation of procedural objections for purposes of appeal. All of \nthese rules and procedures are intended to provide each side with a fair trial. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n120 \n1. Mrs. Robinson has a key witness on auto safety that the judge believes is not qualified as an expert. The \njudge examines the witness while the jury is in the jury room and disqualifies him from testifying. The jury \ndoes not get to hear this witness. Her attorney objects. She loses her case. What argument would you \nexpect Mrs. Robinson’s attorney to make in an appeal? \n2. Why don’t appellate courts need a witness box for witnesses to give testimony under oath? \n3. A trial judge in Nevada is wondering whether to enforce a surrogate motherhood contract. Penelope \nBarr, of Reno, Nevada, has contracted with Reuben and Tina Goldberg to bear the in vitro fertilized egg \nof Mrs. Goldberg. After carrying the child for nine months, Penelope gives birth, but she is reluctant to \ngive up the child, even though she was paid $20,000 at the start of the contract and will earn an \nadditional $20,000 on handing over the baby to the Goldbergs. (Barr was an especially good candidate \nfor surrogate motherhood: she had borne two perfect children and at age 28 drinks no wine, does not \nsmoke or use drugs of any kind, practices yoga, and maintains a largely vegetarian diet with just \nenough meat to meet the needs of the fetus within.) \nThe Goldbergs have asked the judge for an order compelling Penelope to give up the baby, who was \nfive days old when the lawsuit was filed. The baby is now a month old as the judge looks in vain for \nguidance from any Nevada statute, federal statute, or any prior case in Nevada that addressed the \nissue of surrogate motherhood. He does find several well-reasoned cases, one from New Jersey, one \nfrom Michigan, and one from Oregon. Are any of these “precedent” that he must follow? May he \nadopt the reasoning of any of these courts, if he should find that reasoning persuasive? \n \n \n \n \n3.6 When Can Someone Bring a Lawsuit? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts. \n2. Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n121 \n \n \nAlmost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney. But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf.

Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue? Time—and \nthe Supreme Court—will tell. \n \nClass Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n122 \nMost lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other \norganization. But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave. If she does, she will not be \nincluded in an eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n123 \ncannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the \noutcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAnyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has \nstanding will be heard by the courts. Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to \nensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries. Class actions are \na way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Fuchs Funeral Home is carrying the body of Charles Emmenthaler to its resting place at Forest Lawn \nCemetery. Charles’s wife, Chloe, and their two children, Chucky and Clarice, are following the hearse \nwhen the coffin falls on the street, opens, and the body of Charles Emmenthaler falls out. The wife and \nchildren are shocked and aggrieved and later sue in civil court for damages.

For example, they may name the specific person or delegate the responsibility \nof choosing to some neutral person, or they may each designate a person and the two designees may \njointly pick a third arbitrator. \n \nMany arbitrations take place under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, a private \norganization headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many other cities. The association uses \npublished sets of rules for various types of arbitration (e.g., labor arbitration or commercial arbitration); \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n128 \nparties who provide in contracts for arbitration through the association are agreeing to be bound by the \nassociation’s rules. Similarly, the National Association of Securities Dealers provides arbitration services \nfor disputes between clients and brokerage firms. International commercial arbitration often takes place \nthrough the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce. A multilateral agreement known as the \nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards provides that agreements to \narbitrate—and arbitral awards—will be enforced across national boundaries. \n \nArbitration has two advantages over litigation. First, it is usually much quicker, because the arbitrator \ndoes not have a backlog of cases and because the procedures are simpler. Second, in complex cases, the \nquality of the decision may be higher, because the parties can select an arbitrator with specialized \nknowledge. \n \nUnder both federal and state law, arbitration is favored, and a decision rendered by an arbitrator is \nbinding by law and may be enforced by the courts. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding, with very \nfew exceptions (such as fraud or manifest disregard of the law by the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators). \nSaying that arbitration is favored means that if you have agreed to arbitration, you can’t go to court if the \nother party wants you to arbitrate. Under the Federal Arbitration Act, the other party can go to court and \nget a stay against your litigation and also get an order compelling you to go to arbitration. \n \nMediation \nUnlike adjudication, mediation gives the neutral party no power to impose a decision. The mediator is a \ngo-between who attempts to help the parties negotiate a solution. The mediator will communicate the \nparties’ positions to each other, will facilitate the finding of common ground, and will suggest outcomes. \nBut the parties have complete control: they may ignore the recommendations of the mediator entirely, \nsettle in their own way, find another mediator, agree to binding arbitration, go to court, or forget the \nwhole thing! \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n129 \nLitigation is not the only way to resolve disputes. Informal negotiation between the disputants usually comes \nfirst, but both mediation and arbitration are available. Arbitration, though, is final and binding. Once you \nagree to arbitrate, you will have a final, binding arbitral award that is enforceable through the courts, and \ncourts will almost never allow you to litigate after you have agreed to arbitrate. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

At oral argument counsel for plaintiffs conceded that there was no \ntestimony during the trial that either plaintiff Susan Ferlito or her husband, plaintiff Frank J. Ferlito, \nwould have acted any different if there had been a flammability warning on the product’s package. The \nabsence of such testimony is fatal to plaintiffs’ case; for without it, plaintiffs have failed to prove \nproximate cause, one of the essential elements of their negligence claim. \nIn addition, both plaintiffs testified that they knew that cotton batting burns when it is exposed to flame. \nSusan Ferlito testified that she knew at the time she purchased the cotton batting that it would burn if \nexposed to an open flame. Frank Ferlito testified that he knew at the time he appeared at the Halloween \nparty that cotton batting would burn if exposed to an open flame. His additional testimony that he would \nnot have intentionally put a flame to the cotton batting shows that he recognized the risk of injury of \nwhich he claims JJP should have warned. Because both plaintiffs were already aware of the danger, a \nwarning by JJP would have been superfluous. Therefore, a reasonable jury could not have found that \nJJP’s failure to provide a warning was a proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries. \n \nThe evidence in this case clearly demonstrated that neither the use to which plaintiffs put JJP’s product \nnor the injuries arising from that use were foreseeable. Susan Ferlito testified that the idea for the \ncostume was hers alone. As described on the product’s package, its intended uses are for cleansing, \napplying medications, and infant care.

Business and commerce are directly affected \nby the words, meanings, and interpretations of the Constitution. Because it speaks in general terms, \nits provisions raise all kinds of issues for scholars, lawyers, judges, politicians, and commentators. \nFor example, arguments still rage over the nature and meaning of “federalism,” the concept that \nthere is shared governance between the states and the federal government. The US Supreme Court is \nthe ultimate arbiter of those disputes, and as such it has a unique role in the legal system. It has \nassumed the power of judicial review, unique among federal systems globally, through which it can \nstrike down federal or state statutes that it believes violate the Constitution and can even void the \npresident’s executive orders if they are contrary to the Constitution’s language. No knowledgeable \ncitizen or businessperson can afford to be ignorant of its basic provisions. \n \n \n4.1 Basic Aspects of the US Constitution \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Describe the American values that are reflected in the US Constitution. \n2. Know what federalism means, along with separation of powers. \n3. Explain the process of amending the Constitution and why judicial review is particularly significant. \n \n \nThe Constitution as Reflecting American Values \nIn the US, the one document to which all public officials and military personnel pledge their unswerving \nallegiance is the Constitution. If you serve, you are asked to “support and defend” the Constitution \n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The oath usually includes a statement that you swear that this \noath is taken freely, honestly, and without “any purpose of evasion.” This loyalty oath may be related to a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n141 \ntime—fifty years ago—when “un-American” activities were under investigation in Congress and the press; \nthe fear of communism (as antithetical to American values and principles) was paramount. As you look at \nthe Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it \nmay impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign \nand domestic.” \n \nIn Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives \nare elected to public office. Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and \nsmall states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states \nhave two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the \npresidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. \nArticle II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the \nelection process. Article III creates the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, makes \nclear that individual rights must be preserved against activities of the federal government. In general, the \nidea of rights is particularly strong. \n \nThe Constitution itself speaks of rights in fairly general terms, and the judicial interpretation of various \nrights has been in flux. The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is",

United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of \nlotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n148 \nfood and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement \nin prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.” [2] \n \nIn each of those instances, the Supreme Court said, “[T]he use of interstate transportation was necessary \nto the accomplishment of harmful results.” In other words, although the power over interstate \ntransportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of \ninterstate commerce to effect the evil intended. But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was \nlacking. The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the \nlabor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact \nthat they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to \nfederal control under the commerce power.” \n \nIn short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between \nstates. Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it \na fit subject for national regulation. The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a \nmatter of local regulation. The court therefore upheld the result from the district and circuit court of \nappeals; the application of the federal law was enjoined. Goods produced by children under the age of \nfourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United States without violating the federal law. \n \nFrom the New Deal to the New Frontier and the Great  \nSociety: 1930s–1970 \nDuring the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and \nPresident Roosevelt’s New Deal program required more active federal legislation. Included in the New \nDeal program was the recognition of a “right” to form labor unions without undue interference from \nemployers. Congress created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to \nenjoin employer practices that violated this right. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n149 \nIn NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union dispute with management at a large steel-\nproducing facility near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case. In this case, the NLRB had charged \nthe Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation with discriminating against employees who were union members. \nThe company’s position was that the law authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding \nCongress’s powers. The court held that the act was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial \nactivities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce. The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was",

Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging \nthat Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides \na federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional. In \ndismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section \n13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly \nidentified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA. Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed, as \ndid the Supreme Court. \n \nThe Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the authority to enact a statute under the commerce clause \nor the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute did not regulate an activity that substantially affected \ninterstate commerce nor did it redress harm caused by the state. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist \nwrote for the court that “under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and not by the United States.” Dissenting, Justice Stephen G. Breyer argued that the majority \nopinion “illustrates the difficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause touchstone.” Justice \nDavid H. Souter, dissenting, noted that VAWA contained a “mountain of data assembled by \nCongress…showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce.” \n \nThe absence of a workable judicial commerce clause touchstone remains. In 1996, California voters \npassed the Compassionate Use Act, legalizing marijuana for medical use. California’s law conflicted with \nthe federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which banned possession of marijuana. After the Drug \nEnforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-prescribed marijuana from a patient’s home, a group of \nmedical marijuana users sued the DEA and US Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court. \n \nThe medical marijuana users argued that the CSA—which Congress passed using its constitutional power \nto regulate interstate commerce—exceeded Congress’s commerce clause power. The district court ruled \nagainst the group, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional \nbecause it applied to medical marijuana use solely within one state. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit relied \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n152 \non U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000) to say that using medical marijuana did not \n“substantially affect” interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress. \n \nBut by a 6–3 majority, the Supreme Court held that the commerce clause gave Congress authority to \nprohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana, despite state law to the contrary. Justice John Paul \nStevens argued that the court’s precedents established Congress’s commerce clause power to regulate \npurely local activities that are part of a “class of activities” with a substantial effect on interstate \ncommerce. The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a \nclass of activities: the national marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in the national \nmarijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use “essential” to regulating the drug’s national \nmarket. \nNotice how similar this reasoning is to the court’s earlier reasoning in Wickard v. Filburn (Section 4.6.2). \nIn contrast, the court’s conservative wing was adamant that federal power had been exceeded. Justice \nClarence Thomas’s dissent in Gonzalez v. Raich stated that Raich’s local cultivation and consumption of \nmarijuana was not “Commerce…among the several States.” Representing the “originalist” view that the \nConstitution should mostly mean what the Founders meant it to mean, he also said that in the early days \nof the republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, \npossession, and consumption of marijuana. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe commerce clause is the basis on which the federal government regulates interstate economic activity. The \nphrase “interstate commerce” has been subject to differing interpretations by the Supreme Court over the \npast one hundred years.

Understand the role of the supremacy clause in the balance between state and federal power. \n2. Give examples of cases where state legislation is preempted by federal law and cases where state \nlegislation is not preempted by federal law. \n \n \nWhen Congress does use its power under the commerce clause, it can expressly state that it wishes to have \nexclusive regulatory authority. For example, when Congress determined in the 1950s to promote nuclear \npower (“atoms for peace”), it set up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and provided a limitation of \nliability for nuclear power plants in case of a nuclear accident. The states were expressly told to stay out of \nthe business of regulating nuclear power or the movement of nuclear materials. Thus Rochester, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n159 \nMinnesota, or Berkeley, California, could declare itself a nuclear-free zone, but the federal government \nwould have preempted such legislation. If Michigan wished to set safety standards at Detroit Edison’s \nFermi II nuclear reactor that were more stringent than the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s \nstandards, Michigan’s standards would be preempted and thus be void. \n \nEven where Congress does not expressly preempt state action, such action may be impliedly pre-empted. \nStates cannot constitutionally pass laws that interfere with the accomplishment of the purposes of the \nfederal law. Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that sets standards for \nforeign vessels to enter the navigable waters and ports of the United States. If a state creates a law that \nsets standards that conflict with the federal law or sets standards so burdensome that they interfere with \nfederal law, the doctrine of preemption will (in accordance with the supremacy clause) void the state \nlaw or whatever parts of it are inconsistent with federal law.",

It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public \nofficials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the \nprotection of the First Amendment. \n \nPolitical speech is so highly protected that the court has recognized the right of people to support political \ncandidates through campaign contributions and thus promote the particular viewpoints and speech of \nthose candidates. Fearing the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to time placed \nlimitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns. But the Supreme Court has had mixed \nreactions over time. Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment right of a corporation to donate \nmoney, subject to certain limits. [2] In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), the \nMichigan Campaign Finance Act prohibited corporations from using treasury money for independent \nexpenditures to support or oppose candidates in elections for state offices. But a corporation could make \nsuch expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely for political purposes. The law was \npassed on the assumption that “the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitate \nsome regulation of their political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.” \n \nThe Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support a candidate for Michigan’s House of \nRepresentatives by using general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and argued that as a \nnonprofit organization, it was not really like a business firm. The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan \nlaw. Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a business group, given its activities, linkages \nwith community business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75 percent) that were business \ncorporations. Furthermore, Justice Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and \nimplemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining integrity in the political process. But as you \nwill see in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\"), Austin was overruled; \ncorporations are recognized as “persons” with First Amendment political speech rights that cannot be \nimpaired by Congress or the states without some compelling governmental interest with restrictions on \nthose rights that are “narrowly tailored.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n166 \n \nFourth Amendment \nThe Fourth Amendment says, “all persons shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a \nmagistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons to be searched and places to be seized.” \n \nThe court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that \nare “unreasonable.” Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is “closely regulated” can be \nsearched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a \njunkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search \nthat found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, \nbecause the dealer was in a “closely regulated industry.” \n \nIn the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nThe EPA had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow plant, using an aerial mapping \ncamera to photograph various pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof. Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional. Because the literal language of the Fourth Amendment protected “persons, houses, papers, \nand effects,” anything searched by the government in “open fields” was reasonable. (The court’s opinion \nsuggested that if Dow had really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could have covered the \npipes and machinery that were otherwise outside and in open fields.) \n \nNote again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action.

In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents \ngovernment from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also \nconstitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair. This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger \nKing v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, \nbut the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely \ncontract with one another. Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down \nthat aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions. \nHowever, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of \nlaws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties.

And that I cannot do. \n \nIn the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, \nthe Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. But the Court does not say which of these \nAmendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law. \n \n… \n \nAs to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this \nConnecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States. It has \nnot even been argued that this is a law “respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.” And surely, unless the solemn process of constitutional adjudication is to descend to the \nlevel of a play on words, there is not involved here any abridgment of “the freedom of speech, or of the \npress; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of \ngrievances.” No soldier has been quartered in any house. There has been no search, and no seizure. \nNobody has been compelled to be a witness against himself. \n \nThe Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment, and my Brother Goldberg’s concurring opinion relies \nheavily upon it. But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn \nsomersaults with history. The Ninth Amendment, like its companion the Tenth, which this Court held \n“states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,” United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. \n100, 124, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption \nof the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that the Federal Government was to be a government of express \nand limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the \nindividual States. Until today no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment \nmeant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n177 \npassed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James \nMadison no little wonder. \n \nWhat provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid? The Court says it is the right of \nprivacy “created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.” With all deference, I can find no such \ngeneral right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever \nbefore decided by this Court. \n \nAt the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not “conform to current \ncommunity standards.” But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community \nstandards. We are here to decide cases “agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.” It is \nthe essence of judicial duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is \nwise and what is not. If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the \npeople of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth \nAmendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it. That is the constitutional way to \ntake this law off the books. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Which opinion is the strict constructionist opinion here—Justice Douglas’s or that of Justices Stewart and \nBlack? \n2. What would have happened if the Supreme Court had allowed the Connecticut Supreme Court decision to \nstand and followed Justice Black’s reasoning? Is it likely that the citizens of Connecticut would have \npersuaded their elected representatives to repeal the law challenged here? \n \n \nWickard v. Filburn \nWickard v.

Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 \n(1945). \n \nThe extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure. It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local \nconcern. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350. For example, regulations that \ntouch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to \ninvalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited). Indeed, “if safety justifications are \nnot illusory, the Court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison \nwith related burdens on interstate commerce.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 449. Those who would \nchallenge such bona fide safety regulations must overcome a “strong presumption of validity.” Bibb v. \nNavajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 at (1959). \nBut the incantation of a purpose to promote the public health or safety does not insulate a state law from \nCommerce Clause attack. Regulations designed for that salutary purpose nevertheless may further the \npurpose so marginally, and interfere with commerce so substantially, as to be invalid under the \nCommerce Clause. In the Court’s recent unanimous decision in Raymond we declined to “accept the \nState’s contention that the inquiry under the Commerce Clause is ended without a weighing of the \nasserted safety purpose against the degree of interference with interstate commerce.” This “weighing” by a \ncourt requires—and indeed the constitutionality of the state regulation depends on—“a sensitive \nconsideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern in light of the extent of the burden \nimposed on the course of interstate commerce.” Id. at 434 U.S. at 441; accord, Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., \n397 U.S. 137 at 142 (1970);Bibb, supra, at 359 U.S. at 525-530. \n \nIII \nApplying these general principles, we conclude that the Iowa truck length limitations unconstitutionally \nburden interstate commerce. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n183 \nIn Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded \nthe use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as \nin Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-\nfoot singles. Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western \nStates. Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck. In the absence of \ncongressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must \nbe tolerated. But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its \nregulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state \nlaw cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause. \n \n \n \nA \nIowa made a more serious effort to support the safety rationale of its law than did Wisconsin in Raymond, \nbut its effort was no more persuasive. As noted above, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” The record supports this finding. The trial focused on a \ncomparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories. The evidence \nshowed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in \nthe ability to brake, turn, and maneuver. The double, because of its axle placement, produces less splash \nand spray in wet weather. And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to \ndangerous “off-tracking,” and to wind. \n \nNone of these findings is seriously disputed by Iowa. Indeed, the State points to only three ways in which \nthe 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; \nthey may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife. \n \nThe first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways. As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections.

Washington Apple Advertising Commission \nHunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission \n432 U.S. 33 (U.S. Supreme Court 1977) \n \nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nIn 1973, North Carolina enacted a statute which required, inter alia, all closed containers of apples sold, \noffered for sale, or shipped into the State to bear “no grade other than the applicable U.S. grade or \nstandard.”…Washington State is the Nation’s largest producer of apples, its crops accounting for \napproximately 30% of all apples grown domestically and nearly half of all apples shipped in closed \ncontainers in interstate commerce. [Because] of the importance of the apple industry to the State, its \nlegislature has undertaken to protect and enhance the reputation of Washington apples by establishing a \nstringent, mandatory inspection program [that] requires all apples shipped in interstate commerce to be \ntested under strict quality standards and graded accordingly. In all cases, the Washington State grades \n[are] the equivalent of, or superior to, the comparable grades and standards adopted by the [U.S. Dept. of] \nAgriculture (USDA). \n \n[In] 1972, the North Carolina Board of Agriculture adopted an administrative regulation, unique in the 50 \nStates, which in effect required all closed containers of apples shipped into or sold in the State to display \neither the applicable USDA grade or a notice indicating no classification. State grades were expressly \nprohibited. In addition to its obvious consequence—prohibiting the display of Washington State apple \ngrades on containers of apples shipped into North Carolina—the regulation presented the Washington \napple industry with a marketing problem of potentially nationwide significance. Washington apple \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n187 \ngrowers annually ship in commerce approximately 40 million closed containers of apples, nearly 500,000 \nof which eventually find their way into North Carolina, stamped with the applicable Washington State \nvariety and grade. [Compliance] with North Carolina’s unique regulation would have required \nWashington growers to obliterate the printed labels on containers shipped to North Carolina, thus giving \ntheir product a damaged appearance. Alternatively, they could have changed their marketing practices to \naccommodate the needs of the North Carolina market, i.e., repack apples to be shipped to North Carolina \nin containers bearing only the USDA grade, and/or store the estimated portion of the harvest destined for \nthat market in such special containers. As a last resort, they could discontinue the use of the preprinted \ncontainers entirely. None of these costly and less efficient options was very attractive to the industry. \nMoreover, in the event a number of other States followed North Carolina’s lead, the resultant inability to \ndisplay the Washington grades could force the Washington growers to abandon the State’s expensive \ninspection and grading system which their customers had come to know and rely on over the 60-odd \nyears of its existence.… \n \nUnsuccessful in its attempts to secure administrative relief [with North Carolina], the Commission \ninstituted this action challenging the constitutionality of the statute. [The] District Court found that the \nNorth Carolina statute, while neutral on its face, actually discriminated against Washington State growers \nand dealers in favor of their local counterparts [and] concluded that this discrimination [was] not justified \nby the asserted local interest—the elimination of deception and confusion from the marketplace—arguably \nfurthered by the [statute]. \n \n… \n \n[North Carolina] maintains that [the] burdens on the interstate sale of Washington apples were far \noutweighed by the local benefits flowing from what they contend was a valid exercise of North Carolina’s \n[police powers]. Prior to the statute’s enactment,…apples from 13 different States were shipped into North \nCarolina for sale. Seven of those States, including [Washington], had their own grading systems which, \nwhile differing in their standards, used similar descriptive labels (e.g., fancy, extra fancy, etc.). This",

Such \n“downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-\nof-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit. At worst, it will have the effect of an \nembargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them \nfrom the North Carolina market. At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that \nsuch apples would otherwise command. \n \nDespite the statute’s facial neutrality, the Commission suggests that its discriminatory impact on \ninterstate commerce was not an unintended by-product, and there are some indications in the record to \nthat effect. The most glaring is the response of the North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner to the \nCommission’s request for an exemption following the statute’s passage in which he indicated that before \nhe could support such an exemption, he would “want to have the sentiment from our apple \nproducers since they were mainly responsible for this legislation being passed.” [Moreover], we find it \nsomewhat suspect that North Carolina singled out only closed containers of apples, the very means by \nwhich apples are transported in commerce, to effectuate the statute’s ostensible consumer protection \npurpose when apples are not generally sold at retail in their shipping containers. However, we need not \nascribe an economic protection motive to the North Carolina Legislature to resolve this case; we conclude \nthat the challenged statute cannot stand insofar as it prohibits the display of Washington State grades \neven if enacted for the declared purpose of protecting consumers from deception and fraud in the \nmarketplace. \n… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n190 \n \nFinally, we note that any potential for confusion and deception created by the Washington grades was not \nof the type that led to the statute’s enactment. Since Washington grades are in all cases equal or superior \nto their USDA counterparts, they could only “deceive” or “confuse” a consumer to his benefit, hardly a \nharmful result. \n \nIn addition, it appears that nondiscriminatory alternatives to the outright ban of Washington State grades \nare readily available. For example, North Carolina could effectuate its goal by permitting out-of-state \ngrowers to utilize state grades only if they also marked their shipments with the applicable USDA label. In \nthat case, the USDA grade would serve as a benchmark against which the consumer could evaluate the \nquality of the various state grades.… \n \n[The court affirmed the lower court’s holding that the North Carolina statute was unconstitutional.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

An electioneering communication is \ndefined as “any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate \nfor Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. §434(f)(3)(A). \nThe Federal Election Commission’s (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as \na communication that is “publicly distributed.” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2) (2009). “In the case of a candidate \nfor nomination for President…publicly distributed means” that the communication “[c]an be received by \n50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election…is being held within 30 days.” 11 CFR \n§100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express \nadvocacy or electioneering communications. They may establish, however, a “separate segregated fund” \n(known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2 U.S.C. §441b(b)(2).

Section 441b makes it a felony for all \ncorporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or \ndefeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election \nand 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n194 \nClub runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to \ndisapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association \npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports \na handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a \nPresidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic \nexamples of censorship. \n \nSection 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation \ncan still speak. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to \nextensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the \ntreasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve \nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within \n10 days. \n \nAnd that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at \ndifferent times depending on the type of election that is about to occur.… \n \nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the \nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs. PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. \nGiven the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views \nknown regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign. \nSection 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \n“restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a \ncampaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues \ndiscussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1 at 19 (1976).… \n \nSpeech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the \npeople. See Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n195 \ncitizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.”) The right of citizens to \ninquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-\ngovernment and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent \napplication’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” \n \nFor these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or \ninadvertence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the \nGovernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” \n \n… \n \nThe Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784. The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of \ncorporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply \nbecause such associations are not “natural persons.” \n \nThe purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations,",

This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves. \n \nWhat we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government. For the most \npart relinquishing the anti-distortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate \npolitical speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.… \n \nWhen Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may \nnot choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from \nindependent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before \nprinciple, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to \ndispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, \nmust comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is \nthe governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is \nnot a permissible remedy. Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to \npreventing quid pro quo corruption. \n \nOur precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it \nputs us on a course that is sure error. “Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to \nadhere to the principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at \nstake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.” [citing prior cases] \n \nThese considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Austin, which itself contravened this Court’s earlier \nprecedents in Buckley and Bellotti. “This Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the \nFirst Amendment.” WRTL, 551 U.S., at 500 (opinion of Scalia, J.). “[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n197 \nand not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.” Helvering v.

See Smoodin, \n“Compulsory” Viewing for Every Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, \n19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, \nCapra’s Capitol Offense, N. Y. Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5. Under Austin, though, officials could have done \nmore than discourage its distribution—they could have banned the film.

Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force. \n \nModern day movies, television comedies, or skits on YouTube.com might portray public officials or public \npolicies in unflattering ways.

Constitution sets the framework for all other laws of the United States, at both the federal and the \nstate level. It creates a shared balance of power between states and the federal government (federalism) \nand shared power among the branches of government (separation of powers), establishes individual rights \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n200 \nagainst governmental action (Bill of Rights), and provides for federal oversight of matters affecting \ninterstate commerce and commerce with foreign nations. Knowing the contours of the US legal system is \nnot possible without understanding the role of the US Constitution. \n \nThe Constitution is difficult to amend. Thus when the Supreme Court uses its power of judicial review to \ndetermine that a law is unconstitutional, it actually shapes what the Constitution means. New meanings \nthat emerge must do so by the process of amendment or by the passage of time and new appointments to \nthe court. Because justices serve for life, the court changes its philosophical outlook slowly. \n \nThe Bill of Rights is an especially important piece of the Constitutional framework. It provides legal \ncauses of action for infringements of individual rights by government, state or federal. Through the due \nprocess clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, both procedural and (to some \nextent) substantive due process rights are given to individuals. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. For many years, the Supreme Court believed that “commercial speech” was entitled to less protection \nthan other forms of speech. One defining element of commercial speech is that its dominant theme is \nto propose a commercial transaction. This kind of speech is protected by the First Amendment, but the \ngovernment is permitted to regulate it more closely than other forms of speech. However, the \ngovernment must make reasonable distinctions, must narrowly tailor the rules restricting commercial \nspeech, and must show that government has a legitimate goal that the law furthers. \nEdward Salib owned a Winchell’s Donut House in Mesa, Arizona. To attract customers, he displayed \nlarge signs in store windows. The city ordered him to remove the signs because they violated the city’s \nsign code, which prohibited covering more than 30 percent of a store’s windows with signs. Salib sued, \nclaiming that the sign code violated his First Amendment rights. What was the result, and why? \n2. Jennifer is a freshman at her local public high school.

Every day, business must deal with rules and decisions of state \nand federal administrative agencies. Informally, such rules are often called regulations, and they \ndiffer (only in their source) from laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the president. The \nrules created by agencies are voluminous: thousands of new regulations pour forth each year. The \noverarching question of whether there is too much regulation—or the wrong kind of regulation—of \nour economic activities is an important one but well beyond the scope of this chapter, in which we \noffer an overview of the purpose of administrative agencies, their structure, and their impact on \nbusiness. \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n205 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.1 Administrative Agencies: Their Structure and Powers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain the reasons why we have federal administrative agencies. \n2. Explain the difference between executive branch agencies and independent agencies. \n3. Describe the constitutional issue that questions whether administrative agencies could have authority to \nmake enforceable rules that affect business. \n \n \nWhy Have Administrative Agencies? \nThe US Constitution mentions only three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial \n(Articles I, II, and III). There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution, even though federal agencies \nare sometimes referred to as “the fourth branch of government.” The Supreme Court has recognized the \nlegitimacy of federal administrative agencies to make rules that have the same binding effect as \nstatutes by Congress. \n \nMost commentators note that having agencies with rule-making power is a practical necessity: (1) \nCongress does not have the expertise or continuity to develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g., \ncommunications, the environment, aviation). (2) Because of this, it makes sense for Congress to set forth \nbroad statutory guidance to an agency and delegate authority to the agency to propose rules that further \nthe statutory purposes. (3) As long as Congress makes this delegating guidance sufficiently clear, it is not \ndelegating improperly. If Congress’s guidelines are too vague or undefined, it is (in essence) giving away \nits constitutional power to some other group, and this it cannot do. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n206 \nWhy Regulate the Economy at All? \nThe market often does not work properly, as economists often note.

Monopolies, for example, happen in \nthe natural course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1. There are many buyers and many sellers, and none of them has a substantial share of the market. \n2. All buyers and sellers in the market are free to enter the market or leave it. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n207 \n3. All buyers and all sellers have full and perfect knowledge of what other buyers and sellers are up to, \nincluding knowledge of prices, quantity, and quality of all goods being bought or sold. \n4. The goods being sold in the market are similar enough to each other that participants do not have \nstrong preferences as to which seller or buyer they deal with. \n5. The costs and benefits of making or using the goods that are exchanged in the market are borne only by \nthose who buy or sell those goods and not by third parties or people “external” to the market \ntransaction. (That is, there are no “externalities.”) \n6. All buyers and sellers are utility maximizers; each participant in the market tries to get as much as \npossible for as little as possible. \n7. There are no parties, institutions, or governmental units regulating the price, quantity, or quality of any \nof the goods being bought and sold in the market. \n \n \nIn short, some forms of legislation and regulation are needed to counter a tendency toward consolidation \nof economic power and discriminatory attitudes toward certain individuals and groups and to insist that \npeople and companies clean up their own messes and not hide information that would empower voluntary \nchoices in the free market. \n \nBut there are additional reasons to regulate. For example, in economic systems, it is likely for natural \nmonopolies to occur. These are where one firm can most efficiently supply all of the good or service. \nHaving duplicate (or triplicate) systems for supplying electricity, for example, would be inefficient, so \nmost states have a public utilities commission to determine both price and quality of service. This is direct \nregulation. \n \nSometimes destructive competition can result if there is no regulation. Banking and insurance are good \nexamples of this. Without government regulation of banks (setting standards and methods), open and \nfierce competition would result in widespread bank failures. That would erode public confidence in banks \nand business generally. The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, \nhowever, an example of destructive noncompetition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n208 \n \nOther market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation. For example, there is a need to regulate \nfrequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, \nnational defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something \nthat must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods",

These would include making enforceable \ncontracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or \ncrack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage \npartnership. \n \nThus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by \nwhat is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the \nsocial arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or \nunsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers \nfrom unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can \nbe used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment \ndiscrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and \nmonitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental \nProtection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company). \n \nHistory of Federal Agencies \nThrough the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between \nthe states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that \nindependent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may \ndirectly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may \noversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by \nCongress). \n \nPowers of Agencies \nAgencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal \nCommunications Act, gave them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive activity covered \nby the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power \nplant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, the move toward \nderegulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power. Many agencies also have the \nauthority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies \ncan regulate business practices. The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce \nto monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of \nthe stock exchanges. \n \nUnlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific \nassignment or reaching a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the \nday; they must act. They have been given legislative powers because in a society growing ever more \ncomplex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it \nhave the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely because they are to do what \ngeneral legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of experience in \ndealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish \ntheir statutory duties. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n211 \nAll administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel. The heads, whether a single \nadministrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively \nlimited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making \noccurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting \ndata and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies. \n \nThe Constitution and Agencies \nCongress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of \ngovernmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. \nThe most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision. The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency \nactions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 \"Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review\" on \n“Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAdministrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate. But these powers \nare limited by executive and legislative controls and by judicial review. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Find the website of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer. The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more \naccurately reflect their duties. Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free \nof assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the \nagency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function. \nThe accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, \nto cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers.

Describe the paperwork burden imposed by administrative agencies. \n2. Explain why agencies have the power of investigation, and what limits there are to that power. \n3. Explain the need for the Freedom of Information Act and how it works in the US legal system. \n \n \nThe Paperwork Burden \nThe administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes. As long as each company engages in a single line of \nbusiness, data are comparable. When the era of conglomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent \ntypes of businesses brought together under the roof of a single corporate parent, the data became useless \nfor purposes of examining the competitive behavior of different industries. So the FTC ordered dozens of \nlarge companies to break out their economic information according to each line of business that they \ncarried on. The companies resisted, but the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \nwhere much of the litigation over federal administrative action is decided, directed the companies to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n220 \ncomply with the commission’s order, holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act clearly permits the \nagency to collect information for investigatory purposes. [1] \n \nIn 1980, responding to cries that businesses, individuals, and state and local governments were being \nswamped by federal demands for paperwork, Congress enacted the Paperwork Reduction Act. It gives \npower to the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop uniform policies for \ncoordinating the gathering, storage, and transmission of all the millions of reports flowing in each year to \nthe scores of federal departments and agencies requesting information. These reports include tax and \nMedicare forms, financial loan and job applications, questionnaires of all sorts, compliance reports, and \ntax and business records. The OMB was given the power also to determine whether new kinds of \ninformation are needed. In effect, any agency that wants to collect new information from outside must \nobtain the OMB’s approval. \n \nInspections \nNo one likes surprise inspections. A section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers \nagents of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to search work areas for safety \nhazards and for violations of OSHA regulations. The act does not specify whether inspectors are required \nto obtain search warrants, required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases. For many years, the \ngovernment insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a \nwarrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an",

            "chunk": "general manager, Ferrol G. “Bill” Barlow, was on hand; and the OSHA inspector, after showing his \ncredentials, informed Mr. Barlow that he wished to conduct a search of the working areas of the business. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n229 \nMr. Barlow inquired whether any complaint had been received about his company. The inspector \nanswered no, but that Barlow’s, Inc., had simply turned up in the agency’s selection process. The inspector \nagain asked to enter the nonpublic area of the business; Mr. Barlow’s response was to inquire whether the \ninspector had a search warrant. \nThe inspector had none. Thereupon, Mr. Barlow refused the inspector admission to the employee area of \nhis business. He said he was relying on his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. \n \nThree months later, the Secretary petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to \nissue an order compelling Mr. Barlow to admit the inspector. The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries \n“long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. \n72, 74, 77 (1970). These cases are indeed exceptions, but they represent responses to relatively unique \ncircumstances. Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise. Liquor \n(Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a \nbusiness, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation. \n \n* * * \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n231 \nThe clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved \nin Colonnade and Biswell is the exception.

In 1978, the Secretary, acting through the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated a standard limiting occupational \nexposure to cotton dust, an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton \nproducts, exposure to which produces a “constellation of respiratory effects” known as “byssinosis.” This \ndisease was one of the expressly recognized health hazards that led to passage of the Act. \n \nPetitioners in these consolidated cases representing the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the \nvalidity of the “Cotton Dust Standard” in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \npursuant to § 6 (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 655 (f).

Respondents, the Secretary of Labor and two labor \norganizations, counter that Congress balanced the costs and benefits in the Act itself, and that the Act \nshould therefore be construed not to require OSHA to do so. They interpret the Act as mandating that \nOSHA enact the most protective standard possible to eliminate a significant risk of material health \nimpairment, subject to the constraints of economic and technological feasibility. \n \nThe Court of Appeals held that the Act did not require OSHA to compare costs and benefits. \n \nWe granted certiorari, 449 U.S. 817 (1980), to resolve this important question, which was presented but",

Explain how criminal law differs from civil law. \n2. Categorize the various types of crimes and define the most serious felonies. \n3. Discuss and question the criminal “intent” of a corporation. \n4. Explain basic criminal procedure and the rights of criminal defendants. \n \n \nAt times, unethical behavior by businesspeople can be extreme enough that society will respond by \ncriminalizing certain kinds of activities. Ponzi schemes, arson, various kinds of fraud, embezzlement, \nracketeering, foreign corrupt practices, tax evasion, and insider trading are just a few. A corporation \ncan face large fines, and corporate managers can face both fines and jail sentences for violating \ncriminal laws. This chapter aims to explain how criminal law differs from civil law, to discuss various \ntypes of crimes, and to relate the basic principles of criminal procedure. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n241 \n6.1 The Nature of Criminal Law \n \nCriminal law is the most ancient branch of the law. Many wise observers have tried to define and \nexplain it, but the explanations often include many complex and subtle distinctions. A traditional \ncriminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal \nversus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we \nwill consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights. \nUnlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes \ninvolve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state \ngovernment). This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be fair, citizens must \nhave clear notice of what is criminally prohibited. Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to \npunish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly \nvague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for \nvagueness.” \n \nWhat is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time. For example, \nwhile cocaine use was legal in the United States at one time, it is now a controlled substance, and \nunauthorized use is now a crime. Medical marijuana was not legal fifty years ago when its use began \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n242 \nto become widespread, and in some states its use or possession was a felony. Now, some states make \nit legal to use or possess it under some circumstances. In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set",

Other than deterring certain kinds of conduct, what purpose does the criminal law serve? \n2. Why is ignorance of the law no excuse? Why shouldn’t it be an excuse, when criminal laws can be \ncomplicated and sometimes ambiguous? \n \n \n \n \n6.2 Types of Crimes \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat \ncommonly is to expose some fact of the victim’s private life or to make a false accusation about him. \n \nOffenses against Habitation and Other Offenses \nBurglary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n250 \nBurglary is not a crime against property. It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of \nanother in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who \nsneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out \nthe act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room \nfor argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a \nclosed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? \nWhose dwelling? Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person burglarize his \nown home? (No.) \n \nArson \nUnder common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one’s own \nhouse for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law. The statutes today \nmake it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not \nthe purpose is to collect insurance. \nBribery \nBribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in \ncash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find valuable. Under \ncommon law, only a public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges can result from the \nbribe of anyone performing a public function. \n \nBribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. \nBribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. \n \nPerjury \nPerjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official \nproceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”). To be \nperjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without \nsincere belief that it was true. An innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is perjury if \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n251 \nthe maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my \nknowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury. To support a \ncharge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant \nto whatever the court is trying to find out. \n \nWhite-Collar Crime \nWhite-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried \nout in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, \nbut embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory \ndefinitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law. Depending on how they \nare carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law. \n \nAny act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls \nor Internet connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many different acts around the buying and \nselling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws. Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who",

The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who \nuses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be \nconvicted under the law.

For example, \nin a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a \nuse that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water \nAct, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from \n$2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are \nspecifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include \nofficers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused \nthe discharge. [2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation. The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 \"Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"). \nCongress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where \ncomputers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature. \n \nTable 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nObtaining national security information \nSec.

How long a delay is too \nlong depends on the circumstances in each case. In 1975, Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give \npriority to criminal cases in federal courts. It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within \nseventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible reasons for delay). \n \nCross-Examination \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n267 \nThe Sixth Amendment also says that the defendant shall have the right to confront witnesses against him. \nNo testimony is permitted to be shown to the jury unless the person making it is present and subject to \ncross-examination by the defendant’s counsel. \n \nAssistance of Counsel \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to have the assistance of defense counsel. \nDuring the eighteenth century and before, the British courts frequently refused to permit defendants to \nhave lawyers in the courtroom during trial. The right to counsel is much broader in this country, as the \nresult of Supreme Court decisions that require the state to pay for a lawyer for indigent defendants in \nmost criminal cases. \n \nCruel and Unusual Punishment \nPunishment under the common law was frequently horrifying. Death was a common punishment for \nrelatively minor crimes. In many places throughout the world, punishments still persist that seem cruel \nand unusual, such as the practice of stoning someone to death. The guillotine, famously in use during and \nafter the French Revolution, is no longer used, nor are defendants put in stocks for public display and \nhumiliation. In pre-Revolutionary America, an unlucky defendant who found himself convicted could face \nbrutal torture before death. \n \nThe Eighth Amendment banned these actions with the words that “cruel and unusual punishments [shall \nnot be] inflicted.” Virtually all such punishments either never were enacted or have been eliminated from \nthe statute books in the United States. Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment has become a source of \ncontroversy, first with the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1976 that the death penalty, as haphazardly applied \nin the various states, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Later Supreme Court opinions have \nmade it easier for states to administer the death penalty. As of 2010, there were 3,300 defendants on \ndeath row in the United States. Of course, no corporation is on death row, and no corporation’s charter \nhas ever been revoked by a US state, even though some corporations have repeatedly been indicted and \nconvicted of criminal offenses. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n268 \nPresumption of Innocence \nThe most important constitutional right in the US criminal justice system is the presumption of \ninnocence. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned lower courts in the United States that juries must \nbe properly instructed that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. This is the origin of the “beyond \nall reasonable doubt” standard of proof and is an instruction given to juries in each criminal case. The \nFifth Amendment notes the right of “due process” in federal proceedings, and the Fourteenth Amendment \nrequires that each state provide “due process” to defendants. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe US Constitution provides several important protections for criminal defendants, including a prohibition on \nthe use of evidence that has been obtained by unconstitutional means. This would include evidence seized in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment and confessions obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Do you think it is useful to have a presumption of innocence in criminal cases? What if there were not a \npresumption of innocence in criminal cases? \n2. Do you think public humiliation, public execution, and unusual punishments would reduce the amount of \ncrime? Why do you think so? \n3. “Due process” is another phrase for “fairness.” Why should the public show fairness toward criminal \ndefendants? \n \n  \n \n[1] Miranda v.

He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating \nthe situation immediately and would be taking corrective action and would be preparing a summary of the \ncorrective action to reply to the letter.” Respondent stated that he did not “believe there was anything [he] \ncould have done more constructively than what [he] found was being done.” \n \nOn cross-examination, respondent conceded that providing sanitary conditions for food offered for sale to \nthe public was something that he was “responsible for in the entire operation of the company” and he \nstated that it was one of many phases of the company that he assigned to “dependable subordinates.” \nRespondent was asked about and, over the objections of his counsel, admitted receiving, the April 1970 \nletter addressed to him from the FDA regarding insanitary conditions at Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. \nHe acknowledged that, with the exception of the division vice president, the same individuals had \nresponsibility for sanitation in both Baltimore and Philadelphia. Finally, in response to questions \nconcerning the Philadelphia and Baltimore incidents, respondent admitted that the Baltimore problem \nindicated the system for handling sanitation “wasn’t working perfectly” and that as Acme’s chief executive \nofficer he was “responsible for any result which occurs in our company.” \n \nAt the close of the evidence, respondent’s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied. The \nrelevant portion of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury challenged by respondent is set out in the \nmargin. Respondent’s counsel objected to the instructions on the ground that they failed fairly to reflect \nour decision in United States v. Dotterweich supra, and to define “‘responsible relationship.’” The trial \njudge overruled the objection. The jury found respondent guilty on all counts of the information, and he \nwas subsequently sentenced to pay a fine of $50 on each count. The Court of Appeals reversed the \nconviction and remanded for a new trial. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n274 \n \n* * * \n \nThe question presented by the Government’s petition for certiorari in United States v. Dotterweich, and \nthe focus of this Court’s opinion, was whether the manager of a corporation, as well as the corporation \nitself, may be prosecuted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 for the introduction of \nmisbranded and adulterated articles into interstate commerce. In Dotterweich, a jury had disagreed as to \nthe corporation, a jobber purchasing drugs from manufacturers and shipping them in interstate \ncommerce under its own label, but had convicted Dotterweich, the corporation’s president and general \nmanager. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that only the drug dealer, whether \ncorporation or individual, was subject to the criminal provisions of the Act, and that where the dealer was \na corporation, an individual connected therewith might be held personally only if he was operating the \ncorporation as his ‘alter ego.’ \n \nIn reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstating Dotterweich’s conviction, this Court \nlooked to the purposes of the Act and noted that they “touch phases of the lives and health of people \nwhich, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. It observed that \nthe Act is of “a now familiar type” which “dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal \nconduct-awareness of some wrongdoing: In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at \nhazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.

Cf. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 258 (1952). Cases under \nthe Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 reflected the view both that knowledge or intent were not \nrequired to be proved in prosecutions under its criminal provisions, and that responsible corporate agents \ncould be subjected to the liability thereby imposed. \n* * * \n \nThe rationale of the interpretation given the Act in Dotterweich…has been confirmed in our subsequent \ncases. Thus, the Court has reaffirmed the proposition that the public interest in the purity of its food is so \ngreat as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors. \n \nThus Dotterweich and the cases which have followed reveal that in providing sanctions which reach and \ntouch the individuals who execute the corporate mission—and this is by no means necessarily confined to \na single corporate agent or employee—the Act imposes not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy \nviolations when they occur but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that \nviolations will not occur.

We are satisfied \nthat the Act imposes the highest standard of care and permits conviction of responsible corporate officials \nwho, in light of this standard of care, have the power to prevent or correct violations of its provisions. \n \n* * * \n \nReversed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Most criminal law requires a specific \nintent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern \nlegislation, dispense with the requirement of intent). In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies. Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors. Most people have a \ngeneral notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft. But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act.

But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act. It is usually easier to convict someone of attempt or conspiracy than to convict for the main \ncrime, and a person involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony may find that very little is required to put \nhim into serious trouble. \n \nOf major concern to the business executive is white-collar crime, which encompasses a host of offenses, \nincluding bribery, embezzlement, fraud, restraints of trade, and computer crime. Anyone accused of crime \nshould know that they always have the right to consult with a lawyer and should always do so. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Bill is the chief executive of a small computer manufacturing company that desperately needs funds to \ncontinue operating. One day a stranger comes to Bill to induce him to take part in a cocaine smuggling deal \nthat would net Bill millions of dollars. Unbeknownst to Bill, the stranger is an undercover policeman. Bill \ntells the stranger to go away. The stranger persists, and after five months of arguing and cajoling, the \nstranger wears down Bill’s will to resist. Bill agrees to take delivery of the cocaine and hands over a down \npayment of $10,000 to the undercover agent, who promptly arrests him for conspiracy to violate the \nnarcotics laws. What defenses does Bill have? \n2. You are the manager of a bookstore. A customer becomes irritated at having to stand in line and begins to \nshout at the salesclerk for refusing to wait on him. You come out of your office and ask the customer to \ncalm down. He shouts at you. You tell him to leave. He refuses. So you and the salesclerk pick him up and \nshove him bodily out the door. He calls the police to have you arrested for assault. Should the police arrest \nyou? Assuming that they do, how would you defend yourself in court? \n3. Marilyn is arrested for arson against a nuclear utility, a crime under both state and federal law. She is \nconvicted in state court and sentenced to five years in jail. Then the federal government decides to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n278 \nprosecute her for the same offense. Does she have a double-jeopardy defense against the federal \nprosecution? \n4. Tectonics, a US corporation, is bidding on a project in Nigeria, and its employee wins the bid by secretly \ngiving $100,000 to the Nigerian public official that has the most say about which company will be awarded \nthe contract. The contract is worth $80 million, and Tectonics expects to make at least $50 million on the \nproject. Has a crime under US law been committed? \n5. Suppose that the CEO of Tectonics, Ted Nelson, is not actually involved in bribery of the Nigerian public \nofficial Adetutu Adeleke. Instead, suppose that the CFO, Jamie Skillset, is very accomplished at insulating \nboth top management and the board of directors from some of the “operational realities” within the \ncompany. Skillset knows that Whoopi Goldmine, a Nigerian employee of Tectonics, has made the deal with \nAdeleke and secured the contract for Tectonics. Is it possible that Nelson, as well as Skillset, can be found \nguilty of a crime? \n6. You have graduated from college and, after working hard for ten years, have scraped enough money \ntogether to make a down payment on a forty-acre farm within driving distance to the small city where you \nwork in Colorado. In town at lunch one day, you run into an old friend from high school, Hayley Mills, who \ntells you that she is saving her money to start a high-end consignment shop in town. You allow her to have \na room in your house for a few months until she has enough money to go into business. Over the following \nweeks, however, you realize that old acquaintances from high school are stopping by almost daily for short \nvisits. When you bring this up to Hayley, she admits that many old friends are now relying on her for \nmarijuana. She is not a licensed caregiver in Colorado and is clearly violating the law. Out of loyalty, you tell \nher that she has three weeks to move out, but you do not prevent her from continuing sales while she is \nthere. What crime have you committed? \n7.

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

            "chunk": "example, the plaintiff was injured by a spring gun while trespassing on the defendant’s property. [2] The \ndefendant had set up No Trespassing signs after ten years of trespassing and housebreaking events, with \nthe loss of some household items. Windows had been broken, and there was “messing up of the property \nin general.” The defendants had boarded up the windows and doors in order to stop the intrusions and \nfinally had set up a shotgun trap in the north bedroom of the house. One defendant had cleaned and oiled \nhis 20-gauge shotgun and taken it to the old house where it was secured to an iron bed with the barrel \npointed at the bedroom door. “It was rigged with wire from the doorknob to the gun’s trigger so would fire \nwhen the door was opened.” The angle of the shotgun was adjusted to hit an intruder in the legs. The \nspring could not be seen from the outside, and no warning of its presence was posted. \n \nThe plaintiff, Katko, had been hunting in the area for several years and considered the property \nabandoned. He knew it had long been uninhabited. He and a friend had been to the house and found \nseveral old bottles and fruit jars that they took and added to their collection of antiques. When they made \na second trip to the property, they entered by removing a board from a porch window. When the plaintiff \nopened the north bedroom door, the shotgun went off and struck him in the right leg above the ankle \nbone. Much of his leg was blown away. While Katko knew he had no right to break and enter the house \nwith intent to steal bottles and fruit jars, the court held that a property owner could not protect an \nunoccupied boarded-up farmhouse by using a spring gun capable of inflicting death or serious injury. \n \nIn Katko, there is an intentional tort. But what if someone trespassing is injured by the negligence of the \nlandowner? States have differing rules about trespass and negligence. In some states, a trespasser is only \nprotected against the gross negligence of the landowner. In other states, trespassers may be owed the duty \nof due care on the part of the landowner. The burglar who falls into a drained swimming pool, for \nexample, may have a case against the homeowner unless the courts or legislature of that state have made \nit clear that trespassers are owed the limited duty to avoid gross negligence. Or a very small child may \nwander off his own property and fall into a gravel pit on a nearby property and suffer death or serious \ninjury; if the pit should (in the exercise of due care) have been filled in or some barrier erected around it, \nthen there was negligence. But if the state law holds that the duty to trespassers is only to avoid gross \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n291 \nnegligence, the child’s family would lose, unless the state law makes an exception for very young \ntrespassers. In general, guests, licensees, and invitees are owed a duty of due care; a trespasser may not be \nowed such a duty, but states have different rules on this. \n \nIntentional Interference with Contractual Relations \nTortious interference with a contract can be established by proving four elements: \n \n1. There was a contract between the plaintiff and a third party. \n2. The defendant knew of the contract. \n3. The defendant improperly induced the third party to breach the contract or made performance of the \ncontract impossible. \n4. There was injury to the plaintiff. \n \nIn a famous case of contract interference, Texaco was sued by Pennzoil for interfering with an agreement \nthat Pennzoil had with Getty Oil. After complicated negotiations between Pennzoil and Getty, a takeover \nshare price was struck, a memorandum of understanding was signed, and a press release announced the \nagreement in principle between Pennzoil and Getty. Texaco’s lawyers, however, believed that Getty oil was \n“still in play,” and before the lawyers for Pennzoil and Getty could complete the paperwork for their \nagreement, Texaco announced it was offering Getty shareholders an additional $12.50 per share over \nwhat Pennzoil had offered. \n \nTexaco later increased its offer to $228 per share, and the Getty board of directors soon began dealing \nwith Texaco instead of Pennzoil. Pennzoil decided to sue in Texas state court for tortious interference with \na contract. After a long trial, the jury returned an enormous verdict against Texaco: $7.53 billion in actual \ndamages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The verdict was so large that it would have bankrupted \nTexaco. Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution",

The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3] \n \nA statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A \nstatement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major \nnetwork weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show \nthat the words were aimed at them. But statements about large groups will not support an action for \ndefamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor). \nThe law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That a person did not intend to defame is \nordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, \nmagazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due care \nis usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel \ncannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else. Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel. In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement. It may be difficult to \nestablish damages, however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the \nslander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country. Deciding what “commercial” or \n“trade” purposes are is not always easy. Thus a newsmagazine may use a baseball player’s picture on its \ncover without first obtaining written permission, but a chocolate manufacturer could not put the player’s \npicture on a candy wrapper without consent. \n \nPersonal Space \nOne form of intrusion upon a person’s solitude—trespass—has long been actionable under common law. \nPhysical invasion of home or other property is not a new tort. But in recent years, the notion of intrusion \nhas been broadened considerably. Now, taking photos of someone else with your cell phone in a locker \nroom could constitute invasion of the right to privacy. Reading someone else’s mail or e-mail could also \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n296 \nconstitute an invasion of the right to privacy. Photographing someone on a city street is not tortious, but \nsubsequent use of the photograph could be. Whether the invasion is in a public or private space, the \namount of damages will depend on how the image or information is disclosed to others. \n \nPublic Disclosure of Embarassing Facts \nCirculation of false statements that do injury to a person are actionable under the laws of defamation. \nWhat about true statements that might be every bit as damaging—for example, disclosure of someone’s \nincome tax return, revealing how much he earned? The general rule is that if the facts are truly private \nand of no “legitimate” concern to the public, then their disclosure is a violation of the right to privacy. But \na person who is in the public eye cannot claim the same protection. \n \nFalse Light \nA final type of privacy invasion is that which paints a false picture in a publication. Though false, it might \nnot be libelous, since the publication need contain nothing injurious to reputation. Indeed, the publication \nmight even glorify the plaintiff, making him seem more heroic than he actually is. Subject to the First \nAmendment requirement that the plaintiff must show intent or extreme recklessness, statements that put \na person in a false light, like a fictionalized biography, are actionable. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are many kinds of intentional torts. Some of them involve harm to the physical person or to his or her \nproperty, reputation or feelings, or economic interests. In each case of intentional tort, the plaintiff must \nshow that the defendant intended harm, but the intent to harm does not need to be directed at a particular \nperson and need not be malicious, as long as the resulting harm is a direct consequence of the defendant’s \nactions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "The law prohibits the use of a person's picture for advertising purposes or for trade without first obtaining written consent. The aggrieved person can sue for unauthorized profits, recover damages, and have the court enjoin any further unauthorized use of their name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities."

                    "answer": "Actual cause refers to the direct action or event that results in harm or injury. Proximate cause, on the other hand, refers to the foreseeable and reasonable consequences of the actual cause. In a negligence claim, the plaintiff must prove both actual and proximate cause to establish liability."

(There was never any such case, and certainly no such recovery; it is not known who started this \nlegend, or why.) \n \nAnother defense against strict liability as a cause of action is the knowledgeable user defense. If the \nparents of obese teenagers bring a lawsuit against McDonald’s, claiming that its fast-food products are \ndefective and that McDonald’s should have warned customers of the adverse health effects of eating its \nproducts, a defense based on the knowledgeable user is available. In one case, the court found that the \nhigh levels of cholesterol, fat, salt, and sugar in McDonald’s food is well known to users. The court stated, \n“If consumers know (or reasonably should know) the potential ill health effects of eating at McDonald’s, \nthey cannot blame McDonald’s if they, nonetheless, choose to satiate their appetite with a surfeit of \nsupersized McDonald’s products.” [1] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCommon-law courts have long held that certain activities are inherently dangerous and that those who cause \ndamage to others by engaging in those activities will be held strictly liable. More recently, courts in the United \nStates have applied strict liability to defective products.

Before any need for a \ndetermination of illegality arises there must be proof of imprisonment. In 35 Corpus Juris Secundum \n(C.J.S.), False Imprisonment, § II, pages 512–13, it is said: “Submission to the mere verbal direction of \nanother, unaccompanied by force or by threats of any character, cannot constitute a false imprisonment, \nand there is no false imprisonment where an employer interviewing an employee declines to terminate the \ninterview if no force or threat of force is used and false imprisonment may not be predicated on a person’s \nunfounded belief that he was restrained.” \n \nMany cases are cited in support of the text. \n \n* * * \nIn Fenn v. Kroger Grocery & Baking Co., Mo. Sup., 209 S.W. 885, 887, the court said: \n \nA case was not made out for false arrest. The plaintiff said she was intercepted as she started to \nleave the store; that Mr. Krause stood where she could not pass him in going out. She does not say \nthat he made any attempt to intercept her. She says he escorted her back to the desk, that he \nasked her to let him see the change. \n \n…She does not say that she went unwillingly…Evidence is wholly lacking to show that she was \ndetained by force or threats.

University of Denver \n744 P.2d 54 (Supreme Court of Colorado1987) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n313 \nOn June 19, 1978, at approximately 10:00 p.m., plaintiff Oscar Whitlock suffered a paralyzing injury while \nattempting to complete a one-and-three-quarters front flip on a trampoline. The injury rendered him a \nquadriplegic. The trampoline was owned by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity (the Beta house) and was situated \non the front yard of the fraternity premises, located on the University campus. At the time of his injury, \nWhitlock was twenty years old, attended the University of Denver, and was a member of the Beta house, \nwhere he held the office of acting house manager. The property on which the Beta house was located was \nleased to the local chapter house association of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by the defendant University of \nDenver. \n \nWhitlock had extensive experience jumping on trampolines. He began using trampolines in junior high \nschool and continued to do so during his brief tenure as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point, where he learned to execute the one-and-three-quarters front flip. Whitlock testified that he \nutilized the trampoline at West Point every other day for a period of two months. He began jumping on \nthe trampoline owned by the Beta house in September of 1977. Whitlock recounted that in the fall and \nspring prior to the date of his injury, he jumped on the trampoline almost daily. He testified further that \nprior to the date of his injury, he had successfully executed the one-and-three-quarters front flip between \nseventy-five and one hundred times. \n \nDuring the evening of June 18 and early morning of June 19, 1978, Whitlock attended a party at the Beta \nhouse, where he drank beer, vodka and scotch until 2:00 a.m. Whitlock then retired and did not awaken \nuntil 2:00 p.m. on June 19. He testified that he jumped on the trampoline between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 \np.m., and again at 7:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the time of the injury, there again was a party in progress at \nthe Beta house, and Whitlock was using the trampoline with only the illumination from the windows of \nthe fraternity house, the outside light above the front door of the house, and two street lights in the area. \nAs Whitlock attempted to perform the one-and-three-quarters front flip, he landed on the back of his \nhead, causing his neck to break. \n \nWhitlock brought suit against the manufacturer and seller of the trampoline, the University, the Beta \nTheta Pi fraternity and its local chapter, and certain individuals in their capacities as representatives of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n314 \nthe Beta Theta Pi organizations. Whitlock reached settlements with all of the named defendants except \nthe University, so only the negligence action against the University proceeded to trial. The jury returned a \nverdict in favor of Whitlock, assessing his total damages at $ 7,300,000. The jury attributed twenty-eight \npercent of causal negligence to the conduct of Whitlock and seventy-two percent of causal negligence to \nthe conduct of the University. The trial court accordingly reduced the amount of the award against the \nUniversity to $ 5,256,000.",

However, the detention must be reasonable, and the person has the unqualified right to leave the premises once they have paid the demand or the investigation is complete.
