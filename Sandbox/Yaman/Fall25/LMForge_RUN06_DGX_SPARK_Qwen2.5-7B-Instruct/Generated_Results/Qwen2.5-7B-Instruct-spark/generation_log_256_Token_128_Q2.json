Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery).",

By focusing on cash management from the beginning, entrepreneurs can build better financial practices and prepare their businesses for success as they gain traction."

This is because yields on\nfixed-income investments such as bonds will rise as maturity periods increase and produce greater levels of\nrisk.\nCorporate issuers of bonds will usually offer bond issues at higher yields that the government, which is\nunderstandable because they are potentially riskier for investors. Government securities are guaranteed by\ngovernments and have little to no chance of default or nonpayment.

This upward slope is due to the fact that yields on these investments increase as the maturity period lengthens, reflecting the greater risk associated with longer-term investments. As time progresses, there's an increased uncertainty about future economic conditions, which investors typically compensate for by demanding higher returns on their investments."
