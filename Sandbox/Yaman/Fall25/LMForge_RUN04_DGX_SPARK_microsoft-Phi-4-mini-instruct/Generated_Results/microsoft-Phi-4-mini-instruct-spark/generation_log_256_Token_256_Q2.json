The ruling emphasized that the time required to obtain a warrant would not necessarily defeat the element of surprise, thereby upholding the necessity of obtaining a warrant for searches."

It is a financial ratio that calculates the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders' equity. ROE is an important indicator of financial performance and efficiency, as it shows how effectively a company is using its equity base to generate profits. A higher ROE indicates that the company is generating more income per dollar of equity, which can be a sign of strong management and a profitable business model. Conversely, a lower ROE may suggest inefficiencies or challenges in generating profits from the company's equity."
